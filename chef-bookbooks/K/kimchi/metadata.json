{"name":"kimchi","version":"1.0.2","description":"Installs and onfigures kimchi, the kvm graphical interface","long_description":"# Kimchi Cookbook\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/kimchi.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/kimchi) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/kimchi.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/kimchi)\n\nThe kimchi cookbook is designed to create a testing instance of the kimchi project using test kitchen.\n\n## Platform Support\nThe following platforms have been tested:\n- Ubuntu 14.04\n- Centos 6.6\n\n## Requirements\n- chefdk - [https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/)\n- VMWare Fusion\n\n## To use for development\n- Clone this repo\n- Run `bundle install` from the repo directory\n- Run `bundle exec kitchen list` to see OS options\n- Run `bundle exec kitchen converge <instance_name>` to spin up a VM\n- kimchi will be running at [https://localhost:8001](https://localhost:8001) - username/password - vagrant/vagrant\n\n## Caveats\nSince kimchi is a webui for the KVM hypervisor, this cookbook requires VMWare Fusion or physical hardware to function completely. Virtualbox does not support 'VM within a VM' capabilities (no VT-x passthrough).\n\n## License & Authors\n- Author:: Scott Hain ([shain@chef.io](mailto:shain@chef.io))\n\n```text\nCopyright:: 2015 Chef Software, Inc\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n","maintainer":"Scott Hain","maintainer_email":"shain@chef.io","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"centos":">= 0.0.0","amazon":">= 0.0.0","scientific":">= 0.0.0","redhat":">= 0.0.0","oracle":">= 0.0.0","debian":">= 0.0.0","ubuntu":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{"runit":">= 1.6","iptables":">= 0.0.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{}}
