{"name":"kvm","version":"0.4.0","description":"Installs/Configures/tuning kvm","long_description":"# KVM \n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Youscribe/kvm-cookbook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Youscribe/kvm-cookbook)\n[![CK Version](http://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/kvm.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/kvm)\n\n## DESCRIPTION\n\nInstall KVM Hypervisor on Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS or RHEL\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n### OS\n\n* Ubuntu (tested)\n* Debian\n* CentOS (tested host)\n* RHEL\n\n### Cookbooks\n\n* sysctl: https://github.com/Youscribe/sysctl-cookbook\n* modules: https://github.com/Youscribe/modules-cookbook\n* sysfs: https://github.com/Youscribe/sysfs-cookbook\n* cpu: https://github.com/Youscribe/cpu-cookbook\n\n## USAGE\n\n### Default recipe\n\nDetect the server role from OHAI : host or guest. And install minimum packages.\nFor security, the default recipe doesn't install a kvm server, you need to install it with kvm::host\n\n### host recipe\n\nInstall minimum packages and configuration to do kvm virtualization.\n\n### guest recipe\n\nDisable ntp because kvm-clock is preferred in the guest.\n\n### host-tuning recipe\n\nInstall packages and configuration to enhance your kvm host.\n\n* Set vm.swappiness = 0 if the kernel < 3.5 and cpu has ept flag.\n* Load vhost_net module on Ubuntu/debian to speed up networking.\n* Avoid cpu frequency change to prevent potential clock drifting.\n* Enable transparent huge pages\n\n### guest-tuning recipe\n\nInstall packages and configuration to enhance your kvm guest.\n\n* Change the block IO scheduler according to the attribute default[\"kvm\"][\"guest\"][\"tuning\"][\"io_scheduler\"]. By the default the noop scheduler is used.\n","maintainer":"Guilhem Lettron","maintainer_email":"guilhem.lettron@youscribe.com","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"debian":">= 0.0.0","centos":">= 0.0.0","ubuntu":">= 0.0.0","redhat":">= 0.0.0","scientific":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{"ntp":">= 1.2.0","sysctl":">= 0.0.0","modules":">= 0.0.0","sysfs":">= 0.0.0","cpu":">= 0.0.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{}}
