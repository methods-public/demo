# Cookbook Testing

A working ChefDK installation set as your system's default ruby. ChefDK can be downloaded at <https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/>

Hashicorp's [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and a Hypervisor such as VMware's  [Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/workstation-pro.html), [Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/fusion.html) or Oracle's [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for integration testing.

### lint stage

The lint stage runs Ruby specific code linting using cookstyle (<https://github.com/chef/cookstyle>). Cookstyle offers a tailored RuboCop configuration enabling / disabling rules to better meet the needs of cookbook authors. Cookstyle ensures that projects with multiple authors have consistent code styling.

### syntax stage

The syntax stage runs Chef cookbook specific linting and syntax checks with Foodcritic (<http://www.foodcritic.io/>). Foodcritic tests for over 60 different cookbook conditions and helps authors avoid bad patterns in their cookbooks.

### unit stage

The unit stage runs unit testing with ChefSpec (<http://sethvargo.github.io/chefspec/>). ChefSpec is an extension of Rspec, specially formulated for testing Chef cookbooks. Chefspec compiles your cookbook code and converges the run in memory, without actually executing the changes. The user can write various assertions based on what they expect to have happened during the Chef run. Chefspec is very fast, and quick useful for testing complex logic as you can easily converge a cookbook many times in different ways.

## Integration Testing

Integration testing is performed by Test Kitchen. After a successful converge, tests are uploaded and ran out of band of Chef. Tests should be designed to ensure that a recipe has accomplished its goal.

## Integration Testing using Vagrant

Integration tests can be performed on a local workstation using either VirtualBox or VMware as the virtualization hypervisor. To run tests against all available instances run:

```shell
chef exec kitchen test
```

To see a list of available test instances run:

```shell
chef exec kitchen list
```

To test specific instance run:

```shell
chef exec kitchen test INSTANCE_NAME
```

## Windows Images

You may have to modify the `.kitchen.yml` file to reflect the naming standard of your Windows box's
