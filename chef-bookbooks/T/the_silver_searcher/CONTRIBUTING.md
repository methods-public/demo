# Contributing To This Project

Before filing an issue, please read this article by my friends and
former colleagues at Viget:

Keep in mind that I'm no longer paid to write this cookbook, so I'm doing this
in my spare time, which means it might take me a while to respond. If you're not
satisfied with my response to your problem with my free (as in beer and in
speech) software, I will give you triple your $0.00 back.

When filing a pull request, please explain what you're changing and why. Please
use the existing style and add or update tests as needed. Please run Rubocop
and Foodcritic tests with `rake` and make sure there are no errors or warnings.
Please limit your changes to the specific thing you're fixing and isolate your
changes in a topic branch that I can merge without pulling in other stuff.

This cookbook uses the MIT license. If you submit a pull request, I'll assume
you are OK with any code you add being placed under that same MIT license. If
this is not the case for any reason, please let me know why you can't tolerate
the MIT license. I am 99.99% likely to reject your change in that case, but I'll
let you have your say.

This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and
contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor
Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

Thanks for contributing!
