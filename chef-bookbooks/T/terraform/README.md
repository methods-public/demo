terraform Cookbook
==================

Installs [Terraform][terraform] by Mitchell Hashimoto
([@mitchellh](https://github.com/mitchellh)).

[Terraform][terraform] is an open source tool that allows you to
configure entire infrastructure stack as code.

Requirements
------------

### Cookbooks

This cookbook depends on the [ark cookbook](https://supermarket.getchef.com/cookbooks/ark)
and [build-essential](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/build-essential).

### Platforms

The following platforms are supported and have been tested under
[Test Kitchen][testkitchen]:

* CentOS 6.7
* CentOS 7.2
* Debian 8.6
* Fedora 25
* Ubuntu 14.04
* Ubuntu 15.10
* Ubuntu 16.10

Other versions of these OSs should work. Alternative Debian and RHEL
family distributions are also assumed to work. Please [report][issues]
any additional platforms you have tested so they can be added.

Usage
-----

Simply include `recipe[terraform]` in your run_list to have
[Terraform][terraform] installed. If you are using an artifact repository, like Nexus, hosted behind your corporate firewall, you must set the default attribute or override attributes in your roles or environments. The attributes are detailed velow.

Recipes
-------

### default

Installs [Terraform][terraform] from official pre-compiled binaries.


### gpgme

Installs [ruby-gpgme] gem


Attributes
----------

### `node['terraform']['url_base']`

If you are using an artifact repository, like Nexus, hosted behind your corporate firewall, you must set the default attribute or override attributes in your roles or environments.

Default: https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform


### `node['terraform']['version']`

The version of [Terraform][terraform] that will be installed (Default: 0.8.2)

### `node['terraform']['checksum']`

_As of v0.4.1, checksums are processed dynamically. There is no longer a need to specify the sha256 checksums of each terraform package in a cookbook attribute manually_

_As of v1.0.0, the checksum file will have its gpg signature verified. If the gpg signature is rejected, the chef run will fail.

_NOTE: All other attributes are considered internal and shouldn't
normally need to be changed._


#### Example setting default_attributes in a role (JSON file):

```json
{
  "name": "terraform_workstation",
  "description": "Role to apply onto a terraform workstation",
  "json_class": "Chef::Role",
  "default_attributes": {
    "terraform": {
      "url_base": "https://nexus.internal.com/nexus",
      "version": "0.8.2"
    }
  },
  "override_attributes": {},
  "run_list": [
    "recipe[terraform]"
  ]
}
```


Development
-----------

* Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]
* Report issues/questions/feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]

### Contributing

Pull requests are very welcome! Ideally create a topic branch for every
separate change you make.

This cookbook uses [ChefSpec][chefspec] for unit tests. I also use [Food
Critic][foodcritic] and [RuboCop][rubocop] to check for style issues.
When contributing it would be very helpful if you could run these via
`bundle exec spec` and `bundle exec style`.

Lastly, there are [Serverspec][serverspec] integration tests for
use with [Test Kitchen][testkitchen]. To see all of the available
integration test suites just check `bundle exec rake T` or `bundle exec
kitchen list`. It would be great if you could run these tests too, you
may however leave out the Amazon Linux test suite if you do not have
an AWS account as it runs on an EC2 instance (you will be billed for
running this).

### Credit

This cookbook, especially the checksum stuff in
attributes file has been influenced by the [Packer
cookbook](https://supermarket.getchef.com/cookbooks/packer) by
[@sit](https://github.com/sit).
