For example, there are tasks defined to allow one-liners for running tests, style checks, and tagging/deployment.  \nCheck the `Rakefile` out for more information. You can also run `rake -T` to get a listing and description of what each task does.\n\n## Resource Providers\n### ts3_server_install\nInstalls the TeamSpeak 3 server.\n\n| Attribute | Required? | Type | Default | Usage |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| install_dir | true | String | --- | The location on the filesystem to install the TS3 server to. |\n| version | true | String | --- | The version of the server software to install. |\n\n### ts3_server_configure\nConfigures a TeamSpeak 3 server.\n\n| Attribute | Required? | Type | Default | Usage |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| user | true | String | teamspeakd | The username of the system account which manages the server. |\n| install_dir | true | String | --- | The location of the server on the filesystem. |\n| server_name | false | String | server | The alias for this server.
