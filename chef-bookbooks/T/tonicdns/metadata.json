Default - `true`\n\n`node[\"TonicDNS\"][\"git_repo\"]` - download URL for TonicDNS. Default - `https://github.com/Cysource/TonicDNS.git`\n\n`node[\"TonicDNS\"][\"package_name\"]` - name for local package located in files/default. Default - `tonicdns-git.tar.gz`\n\n`node[\"TonicDNS\"][\"install_dir\"]` - Docroot for apache2 where TonicDNS will be located. Default - `/var/www/TonicDNS`\n\n`node[\"poweradmin\"][\"http_port\"]` - port where TonicDNS API could be found. Default - `8080`\n\n`node[\"tonicdns\"][\"user\"]` - User that will be created to serve API requests. Default - `tonicdns`\n\n`node[\"tonicdns\"][\"user_email\"]` - email for user created to serve API requests. Default - `sampleuser@example.org`\n\nHere is a block of mysql connection settings - it should be easy to understand what value stands for.\n\nShould be the same, previously used to configure pdns-backend-mysql.\n\n`node[\"tonicdns\"][\"hostname\"]` = `'localhost'`\n\n`node[\"tonicdns\"][\"username\"]` = `'powerdns'`\n\n`node[\"tonicdns\"][\"password\"]` = `'p4ssw0rd'`\n\n`node[\"tonicdns\"][\"dbname\"]` = `'powerdns'`\n\n## Usage\n\n### tonicdns::default\nUse `recipe[tonicdns::default]` to deploy TonicDNS API on your working copy of PowerDNS with mysql-backend.\n\n### tonicdns::test\nUse `recipe[tonicdns::test]` to deploy TonicDNS API alongside with test deployment of PowerDNS+mysql-backend used in this [chef-pdns](https://github.com/podwhitehawk/chef-pdns) test cookbook.\n\nBut it's not recomended to use it in such way. At least right now.\n\n\n## Contributing\nYour contributions is highly appreciated.\nHere is standart instruction how to do so:\n\n1. Fork the repository on Github\n2.
