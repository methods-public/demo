Unit tests are in ChefSpec.\n\n## To verify\n\nVerified with ChefDK v0.17.17. Should work with ChefDK v0.12.0 or higher.\n\nIf you're using ChefDK ~> 0.11, look at [v0.1.4] of this cookbook for instructions on testing.\n\n```bash\n$ kitchen verify\n```\n\n## Development\n\n* [GitHub]\n* [Supermarket]\n* [Issues, questions, requests]\n\n## Author\n\nCreated and maintained by Kevin Dickerson of [Loom]. <kevin.dickerson@loom.technology>.\n\n[Loom]: https://loom.technology\n[GitHub]: https://github.com/loom-cookbooks/example\n[Supermarket]: https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/example\n[Issues, questions, requests]: https://github.com/loom-cookbooks/example/issues\n[v0.1.4]: https://github.com/loom-cookbooks/example/tree/v0.1.4\n[example_resources]: https://github.com/loom-cookbooks/example_resources\n",
