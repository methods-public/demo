It's a library cookbook because it defines resources as LWRPs in the `/libraries` directory.\n\nThese resources are compatible with Chef 12.5 or higher, but are still declared without using the new resource style introduced in Chef 12.5. For an example on using Chef 12.5+ resources, see the cookbook [example_resources][example_resources].\n\nThe purpose of this cookbook is to illustrate the relationship between a cookbook that defines a new Chef resource, and another cookbook that consumes it.\n\n## To test\n\nInstall [ChefDK][chefdk] 0.12.0 or higher.  (Test Kitchen 1.6.0 or higher is required. Test Kitchen 1.6.0 is bundled with  0.12.0 or higher.)\n\n```bash\n$ kitchen verify\n```\n\n## Development\n\n* [GitHub][repository]\n* [Supermarket][supermarket]\n* [Issues, questions, requests][issues]\n\n## Author\n\nCreated and maintained by Kevin Dickerson of [Loom](loom). <kevin.dickerson@loom.technology>.\n\n[loom]: https://loom.technology\n[repository]: https://github.com/loom-cookbooks/example_library\n[supermarket]: https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/example_library\n[issues]: https://github.com/loom-cookbooks/example_library/issues\n[chefdk]: https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/\n[example_resources]: https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/example_resources\n",
