I wrote another cookbook called [example], which consumes the resource defined here.\n\n[example]: https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/example\n\n## To test\n\nThis cookbook was tested most recently with ChefDK v0.17.17. It should work with ChefDK v0.12.0 or higher.\n\nIf you're using ChefDK ~> 0.11, look at [v1.0.7] of this cookbook for instructions on testing.\n\n```bash\n$ kitchen verify\n```\n\n## Development\n\n* [GitHub]\n* [Supermarket]\n* [Issues, questions, requests]\n\n## Author\n\nCreated and maintained by Kevin Dickerson of [Loom]. <kevin.dickerson@loom.technology>.\n\n[Loom]: https://loom.technology\n[GitHub]: https://github.com/loom-cookbooks/example_resources\n[Supermarket]: https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/example_resources\n[Issues, questions, requests]: https://github.com/loom-cookbooks/example_resources/issues\n[chefdk]: https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/\n[v1.0.7]: https://github.com/loom-cookbooks/example_resources/tree/v1.0.7\n[example_resources]: https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/example_resources\n",
