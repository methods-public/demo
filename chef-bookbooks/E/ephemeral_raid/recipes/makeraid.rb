# Notes:
#
# This recipe based directly on that by Mike Heffner of Librato:
# https://github.com/librato/basenode-chef-kitchen/blob/master/cookbooks/ephemeral/recipes/raid_ephemeral.rb
#
# Which was in turn modeled after the following :
# https://github.com/riptano/CassandraClusterAMI/blob/master/.startcassandra.py
#

# Obtain the available ephemeral devices. See "libraries/helper.rb" for the definition of
# "get_ephemeral_devices" method.
ephemeral_devices = EphemeralDevices::Helper.get_ephemeral_devices(node.cloud.provider, node)


if ( node[:ephemeral][:raid][:level].to_s == "0" )
  # We call the mdadm resource provider without a bitmap or spares entry.
  mdadm "#{node[:ephemeral][:raid][:device]}" do
    devices ephemeral_devices
    chunk node[:ephemeral][:raid][:chunk_size] if node[:ephemeral][:raid][:chunk_size]
    level 0
    action :create
    notifies :run, "execute[set_readahead_on_device_after_creation]", :immediately
    only_if "which mdadm"
  end
