{"name":"entropy","version":"1.1.1","description":"Ensures a good source of entropy","long_description":"# entropy cookbook\n\nThis cookbook will install an entropy gathering daemon on lots of different platforms.\n\nApplications can hang or become very slow due to lack of entropy, especially when generating\nkeys (like RSA or GPG keys). Installing an entropy gathering daemon gives the OS a relatively \nhigh quality source of entropy.\n\n## Entropy daemons\n\n### haveged \n\nRight now, this cookbook only supports install haveged. This is an entropy gathering daemon that\nI have a lot of experience with and that is well supported on lots of platforms. I am totally open\nto implementing recipes for other entropy gathering daemons as well.\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\nSee [metadata.rb](metadata.rb) for the list of supported platforms\n\n## Usage\n\nThis cookbook is available on the public supermarket.\n\nDepend on the `entropy` cookbook in your cookbook's metadata.rb file\n \n`depends 'entropy'`\n\n### default recipe\n\nAdd the default recipe to your run list\n\n`recipe[entropy]`\n\nThis will install an entropy gathering daemon for your platform (if supported).\n\n## License and Authors\n\nAuthor:: Ryan Larson (ryan.mango.larson@gmail.com)\n","maintainer":"Ryan Larson","maintainer_email":"ryan.mango.larson@gmail.com","license":"MIT","platforms":{"ubuntu":">= 12.04","debian":">= 7.0","centos":">= 5.0","oracle":">= 5.0","redhat":">= 5.0","fedora":">= 18.0","suse":">= 11.0"},"dependencies":{"yum-epel":"> 2.0.0","apt":">= 0.0.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"chef_version":[],"ohai_version":[]}
