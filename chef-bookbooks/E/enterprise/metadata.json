If you are building top-level (non add-on) project, set it to your project name.\n\nIn addition, you need to have:\n\n- `node[project_name]['install_path']` the install location for your omnibus project (e.g. `/opt/chef-server`).\n\nOptional attributes are:\n\n- `node[project_name]['sysvinit_id']` an identifier used in `/etc/inittab` (default is `'SV'`). Needs to be a unique (for the file) sequence of 1-4 characters.\n- `node[project_name]['topology']` one of `standalone`, `tier`, or `ha`.\n- `node[project_name]['role']` either `backend` or `frontend`.\n- `node[project_name]['servers'][node_name]['bootstrap']` is used to determine if the node is installation bootstrap server. Value is treated as boolean.\n- `node[project_name]['keepalived']['dir']` directory for keepalived.\n\n## Recipes\n\n### runit\n\nSets the proper attributes to use runit and creates a runit supervisor to be used by component runit services.\n\n## Definitions\n\n### component_runit_service\n\nDefines a runit service.\n\n## Resources\n\n### component_runit_supervisor\n\nCreates a runit runsvdir process to monitor component runit processes.\n\n#### Properties\n\n- `name` - The name of the project\n- `ctl_name` - Name of the command used to manage the services. Defaults to `#{name}-ctl`.\n- `sysvinit_id - Two-letter prefix used to identify the service on sysvinit-style systems. Defaults to`\"SV\"`.\n- `install_path` - Path where the project is installed.\n\n#### Actions\n\n- `:create` - Create the necessary files and start the runsvdir service.\n- `:delete` - Stop the services and the runsvdir service and remove the files.\n\n#### Providers\n\n- `Chef::Provider::ComponentRunitSupervisor::Systemd` - For systems using systemd.\n- `Chef::Provider::ComponentRunitSupervisor::Sysvinit` - For systems using sysvinit.\n- `Chef::Provider::ComponentRunitSupervisor::Upstart` - For systems using Upstart.\n\n## Testing\n\n[ChefDK](http://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/) must be installed\n\n### ChefSpec\n\nRun `chef exec rspec` to run ChefSpec examples.\n\n### Test Kitchen\n\nIntegration tests can be run with [Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci/).\n\n## Maintainers\n\nThis cookbook is maintained by Chef's Community Cookbook Engineering team.
