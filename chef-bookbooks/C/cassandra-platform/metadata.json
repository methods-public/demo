  "long_description": "Cassandra Platform\n=============\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nInstall/Configure an Apache Cassandra cluster.\n\nCassandra is a free and open-source distributed database management system\ndesigned to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n### Cookbooks and gems\n\nDeclared in [metadata.rb](metadata.rb) and in [Gemfile](Gemfile).\n\n### Platforms\n\nA *systemd* managed distribution:\n- RHEL Family 7, tested on Centos\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n### Test\n\nThis cookbook is fully tested through the installation of a working 3-nodes\ncluster in docker hosts. This uses kitchen, docker and some monkey-patching.\n\nFor more information, see [.kitchen.yml](.kitchen.yml) and [test](test)\ndirectory.\n\n\n### Easy Setup\n\nSet `node['cassandra-platform']['hosts']` to an array containing the\nhostnames of the nodes of the Cassandra cluster.\n\n### Search\n\nThe recommended way to use this cookbook is through the creation of a role per\n**Cassandra** cluster. This enables the search by role feature, allowing a\nsimple service discovery.\n\nIn fact, there are two ways to configure the search:\n\n1. With a static configuration through a list of hostnames (attributes `hosts`\n   that is `node['cassandra-platform']['hosts']`) for nodes belonging to\n   Cassandra cluster). Actually, only seeds are necessary.\n2. With a real search, performed on a role (attributes `role` and `size`\n   like in `node['cassandra-platform']['role']`).\n   The role should be in the run-list of all seeds of the cluster.\n   The size is a safety and should be the number of nodes of this role.\n\nIf hosts is configured, `role` and `size` are ignored\n\nSee [roles](test/integration/roles) for some examples and\n[Cluster Search][cluster-search] documentation for more information.\n\nAttributes\n----------\n\nConfiguration is done by overriding default attributes. All configuration keys\nhave a default defined in:\n\n[attributes/default.rb](attributes/default.rb),\n[attributes/systemd.rb](attributes/systemd.rb).\n\nPlease read it to have a comprehensive view of what and how you can configure\nthis cookbook behavior.\n\nRecipes\n-------\n\n### default\n\nInclude `search`, `user`, `install`, `config` and `systemd ` recipes.\n\n### search\n\nSearch Cassandra nodes that should join the cluster using\n[Cluster Search][cluster-search].\n\n### user\n\nCreate user/group used by Cassandra.\n\n### install\n\nInstall Apache Cassandra from an Apache mirror.\n\n### config\n\nGenerate and deploy Cassandra config.\n\n### systemd\n\nCreate systemd unit for Cassandra and make sure service is started.\n\n### backup\n\nInstall the script `cassandra_backup.sh` in `prefix_bin` which can be launched\nto perform a full backup of a cassandra node.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPlease read carefully [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a merge\nrequest.\n\nLicense and Author\n------------------\n\n- Author:: Vincent Baret (<vbaret@gmail.com>)\n- Author:: Samuel Bernard (<samuel.bernard@gmail.com>)\n- Author:: Florian Philippon (<florian.philippon@gmail.com>)\n\n```text\nCopyright (c) 2017 Sam4Mobile, 2017-2018 Make.org\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n\n[cluster-search]: https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/cluster-search\n",
