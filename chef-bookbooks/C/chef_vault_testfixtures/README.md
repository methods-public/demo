# chef_vault_testfixtures

*This cookbook has been deprecated*

For unit testing, use the [chef-vault-testfixtures gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/chef-vault-testfixtures)

For integration testing, use the helper provided by the [chef-vault cookbook](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/chef-vault)

Both these solutions use the same source of test data (a JSON file
in the `test/integration/data_bags` folder).
