{"name":"cleanup","version":"0.2.1","description":"Installs/Configures cleanup","long_description":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/racker/cookbook-cleanup.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/racker/cookbook-cleanup)\n[![Chef cookbook](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/cleanup.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/cleanup)\n\nDescription\n===========\n\nThis cookbook creates a `cleanup` resource to handle the cleanup of arbitrary paths based on number of files or last modified dates.\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\n- `name` - String representing a path glob so wildcards are totally fine.\n- `dry_run` - `true`/`false` Defaults to `false`. If `true` will disable actual file operations.`\n- `files` - `true`/`false` Defaults to `true`. If false will ignore files during cleanup.\n- `directories` - `true`/`false` Defaults to `true`. If false will ignore directories during cleanup.\n- `sort_by` - `:atime`/`:ctime`/`:mtime` Defaults to `:mtime`. Sort the files to be deleted by their (a)ccess, (c)reate or (m)odified time.\n\n`keep_last` and `older_than` are mutally exclusive since I can't think of any way combining them makes sense.\n\n- `keep_last` - Takes an integer. Will keep that many files starting from the most recent.\n- `older_than` - Takes a hash that looks like `{:time_increment => time_quantity}`. Increments can be one of [:minutes, :hours, :days, :weeks] (months are hard).\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nInclude the cookbook then just call the `cleanup` resource from your recipe like this:\n\n### Keep the most recent 5 files\n```ruby\ncleanup \"/your/path/here/*\" do\n  keep_last 5\nend\n```\n### Delete files older than 1 week\n```ruby\ncleanup \"/your/path/here/*\" do\n  older_than :weeks => 1\nend\n```\n","maintainer":"Rackspace","maintainer_email":"dave.king@rackspace.com","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"centos":">= 0.0.0","debian":">= 0.0.0","ubuntu":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"source_url":"https://github.com/racker/cookbook-cleanup","issues_url":"https://github.com/racker/cookbook-cleanup/issues","chef_version":[],"ohai_version":[]}
