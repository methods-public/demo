This LWRP will create bashrc.d folder if not present.\n\nIf an existing bashrc file exists in user home folder, it will be saved in a permanent init file at the very first run and then will be merged each time LWRP is called.\n\n### Action\n* `add:` (default) - add a specified file to bashrc.d folder and merge all files from this folder to given user bashrc file.\n* `remove:` - remove a specified file from bashrc.d folder.\n\n## Attributes\n\n* `filename` - name of the file\n\n* `user` - user to interact with. Group and home folder will be automaticly resolved from system informations.\n\n* `content` - String to be set on the new profile file. It easily works with simple string, multiline string, or strings loaded from a file.\n\n#### Syntax\n\n    bashrc_manager 'profile.addin' do\n      user 'jdoe'\n      content \"PATH=/home/jdoe/my_bin:$PATH\"\n    end\n\n## Testing\n\nIncludes basic [chefspec](sethvargo/chefspec) support and matchers.\n\n1. `bundle install`\n2. `rspec`\n\n## Author\n\nAuthor:: Table XI (<sysadmins@tablexi.com>)\n","maintainer":"TableXI","maintainer_email":"sysadmins@tablexi.com","license":"MIT","platforms":{"centos":">= 0.0.0","redhat":">= 0.0.0","amazon":">= 0.0.0","ubuntu":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"source_url":"https://github.com/tablexi/chef-bashrc_manager","issues_url":"https://github.com/tablexi/chef-bashrc_manager/issues","chef_version":[["~> 12"]],"ohai_version":[]}
