{"name":"bash-shellshock","version":"1.0.1","description":"Audits & remediates the Shellshock vulnerability","long_description":"bash-shellshock Cookbook\n=================\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/bash-shellshock.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/bash-shellshock)\n[![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/bash-shellshock.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/bash-shellshock)\n\nThis cookbook is designed to test and optionally remediate the bash \"shellshock\" bug, more formally known as cve-2014-7169.\n\nOnce Chef-client has executed this recipe on one or more hosts, a list of all nodes that are vulnerable to the \"Shellshock\" exploit can be retrieved from the Chef server via `knife search:`\n\n`knife search node 'bash:shellshock_vulnerable'`\n\nLimitations\n------------\nThis cookbook relies on the OS-native packaging system to provide patched versions of the bash package.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n#### Platforms\n* Tested on CentOS 6.5\n* Tested on Ubuntu 12.04\n* Should work on a wide variety of other systems\n\n#### Chef\n- Chef 11+\n\n#### Cookbooks\n* ohai (https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/ohai)\n\nAttributes\n----------\n\n* No user-configurable attributes\n\nRecipes\n-------\n\n### bash-shellshock::default\n\n* Audits and remediates Bash-CVE-2014-7169 (\"Shellshock\")\n\n### bash-shellshock::audit\n\n* Installs an OHAI plugin that will automatically audit nodes for the Shellshock vulnerability. This plugin creates two new values in OHAI:\n\n  node['languages']['bash']['version'], a string. Returned from `bash --version`.\n  node['languages']['bash']['shellshock_vulnerable'], a boolean. True if node is vulnerable.\n\n### bash-shellshock::remediate\n\n* If the node is marked vulnerable by the audit recipe, this recipe will attempt to upgrade bash via the native packaging system. Includes the audit recipe.\n* Audits and remediates Bash-CVE-2014-7169 (\"Shellshock\")\n\n\nLicense & Authors\n-----------------\n\n**Author:** Cookbook Engineering Team (<cookbooks@chef.io>)\n\n**Copyright:** 20014-2015, Chef Software, Inc.\n\n```\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n","maintainer":"Chef Software, Inc.","maintainer_email":"cookbooks@chef.io","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"centos":">= 0.0.0","debian":">= 0.0.0","fedora":">= 0.0.0","freebsd":">= 0.0.0","gentoo":">= 0.0.0","redhat":">= 0.0.0","scientific":">= 0.0.0","oracle":">= 0.0.0","ubuntu":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{"ohai":"~> 2.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{"bash-shellshock::default":"Audits & remediates cve-2014-7169 (Shellshock)","bash-shellshock::audit":"Audits nodes for cve-2014-7169 (Shellshock)","bash-shellshock::remediate":"Audits & remediates cve-2014-7169 (Shellshock)"}}
