Take a look into the [`helloworld recipe`](test/fixtures/cookbooks/opengrok_test/recipes/helloworld.rb).\n2. Adapt the `helloworld recipe` to your own cookbook wrapper, especially the generation of the `src` directory.\n\n    You can use any chef resources from any community cookbooks to populate that `src` directory as long as its supported by OpenGrok, e.g. git resource, subversion resource, etc. \n\n3. Schedule `chef-client` as a cron job. This will be the point where your `src` is being updated periodically and indexed by Chef\n\n    You can use the [chef-client::cron](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/chef-client#cron) recipe.\n\n## Resources\n\n### opengrok_install\n\nopengrok_install installs an instance of opengrok and all of its required dependencies\nand files.
