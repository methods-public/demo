# WARNING: please read README.spamd before using.

# Change to one to enable spamd
ENABLED=<%= @enabled ? '1' : '0' %>

# Options
# See man spamd for possible options. The -d option is automatically added.

# SpamAssassin uses a preforking model, so be careful! You need to
# make sure --max-children is not set to anything higher than 5,
# unless you know what you're doing.

OPTIONS="<%= @options.join(' ') %>"

# Pid file
# Where should spamd write its PID to file? If you use the -u or
# --username option above, this needs to be writable by that user.
# Otherwise, the init script will not be able to shut spamd down.
PIDFILE="<%= @pidfile %>"

# Set nice level of spamd
<% unless @nice.nil? -%>
NICE="--nicelevel <%= @nice %>"
<% else -%>
#NICE="--nicelevel 15"
<% end -%>

# Cronjob
# Set to anything but 0 to enable the cron job to automatically update
# spamassassin's rules on a nightly basis
CRON=0
