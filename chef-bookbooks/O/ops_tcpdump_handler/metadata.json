  "long_description": "# About: ops_tcpdump_handler\n\nThis cookbook is for local testing purposes only. It installs and\nconfigures tcpdump, then sets that up as a service to monitor traffic\nduring the chef run. At the end of the run, a handler will read and\nprint out the sniffed network traffic.\nInspired by [huchen](https://github.com/acrmp/huchen).\n\n\n# Usage:\n\nIf you are using Berkshelf for dependency resolution add an entry in your Berksfile, probably in a group:\n```\ngroup :development do\n  cookbook 'ops_tcpdump_handler'\nend\n```\n\nPlace the cookbook at the beginning of your local run_list. For example,\nin vagrant:\n\n```\ncfg.vm.provision :chef_client do |chef|\n  chef.add_recipe 'ops_tcpdump_handler'\n  chef.add_recipe 'another_recipe'\nend\n```\n\nThen, at the end of your run you should see something similar to:\n\n```\n...\n==> node01: attempted to connect to: proxy06.fedoraproject.org using http\n==> node01: attempted to connect to: mirror.sfo12.us.leaseweb.net using http\n==> node01: attempted to connect to: li63-48.members.linode.com using https\n==> node01: attempted to connect to: 23.235.40.133 using https\n==> node01: attempted to connect to: github.com using https\n==> node01: attempted to connect to: codeload.github.com using https\n==> node01: attempted to connect to: s3-1.amazonaws.com using https\n...\n```\n\n# Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n# Warning\n\nThis is for local testing only. Do not apply this cookbook to a\nproduction node.\n\nIf your cookbook relies on the [runit community cookbook](https://github.com/hw-cookbooks/runit) then any calls to the internet made by that cookbook will\nnot show up in the logs as runit has already been configure before this\nservice begins monitoring traffic.\n\n# LICENSE\n\nCopyright 2015 Cerner Innovation, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
