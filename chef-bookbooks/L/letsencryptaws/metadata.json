  "long_description": "# letsencryptaws Cookbook\n\nThis cookbook is for an implementation of SSL certificate generation and fetching via the Let's Encrypt certificate authority. Certificates are synced from local storage to S3, which is then used by nodes to retrieve the generated certificate. Authentication is done via DNS challenges and automated via Ruby scripts to add and remove TXT records from your domain when required.\n\nNodes do not need to be EC2 instances to retrieve or request certificates. All that is required is AWS credentials or profile to perform Route 53 and S3 operations.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 2.7 (for certbot and awscli)\n- certbot ACME client\n- Domain(s) hosted by AWS Route 53 (only second-level domains, subdomain zones are not supported)\n- S3 bucket for storing/retrieving certificate files\n- Properly stored AWS credentials (see https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby#configuration)\n\n### Platforms\n\nCertificate generation:\n- Ubuntu\n\nThe goal for certificate retrieval is to support Windows but for now, Ubuntu only.\n\n### Cookbooks\n\n- `remote_file_s3` - To grab certificates from S3\n- `poise-python` - For grabbing awscli for certificate syncing.\n\n## Usage\n\n### letsencryptaws::default\n\nSet the `certs` attribute as described below and then include this recipe in your cookbook or run_list.\n\n**NOTE** You should manually generate a default certificate (self-signed/fake CA) and place the key, certificate and CA certificate at the `\"/#{node['letsencryptaws']['sync_path']}/default-ssl\"` path in your S3 sync bucket. These will act as stand-ins for the real certificates/key until they are generated by `letsencryptaws::certbot` after they are first \"requested\" by a node. So in theory, your real certificates will take up to (chef interval + splay * 3) until they land on the requesting node.\n\nThe flow looks like this:\n- First Chef run on requesting node. Attribute (`['letsencryptaws']['certs']['example.com'] = []`) gets saved to server (probably created dynamically by a cookbook). Default cert/key gets saved to node from S3.\n- Chef run on 'certbot' host. Requests certificate and uploads to S3.\n- Second Chef run on requesting node overwrites the previously saved default cert/key with real cert/key from S3.\n\nAny service that uses a certificate provided by this recipe should subscribe to one of the certificate file resources so that it can be reloaded when the certificate is renewed. For example:\n\n```\nservice 'nginx' do\n  action %i[start enable]\n  subscribes :restart, \"file[#{::File.join(node['letsencryptaws']['ssl_cert_dir'], 'example.com.crt')}]\", :delayed\nend\n```\n\n### letsencryptaws::certbot\n\nThis is meant to be run by a single host that manages fetching certificates based on a Chef server `search`. Make sure the instance profile or AWS access keys in the data bag is granted the following permissions on the domains in which you allow certificates to be requested by nodes:\n\n- `route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets`\n- `route53:ListHostedZonesByName`\n- `route53:GetChange`\n\nThe credentials will also require write access to the S3 bucket and path that you choose to sync to. The authenticator and cleanup scripts do not use the credential information from the data bag, so it is left up to the user to place the `.aws/credentials` file in the proper location, if not using an instance profile.\n\nIf you desire persistent storage on an EBS volume, use the `['letsencryptaws']['ebs_device']` to specify the path to the device. This will device will have an ext4 filesystem created on it if one does not already exist and be mounted at `['letsencryptaws']['config_dir']`. This is where certbot will store its configs and certificates. All operations take place locally at this path and at the end of the recipe gets synced to S3.\n\nCertbot operations use the `--expand` and `--cert-name` arguments to keep the certificates up-to-date with the requested names. This means the certificate will be renewed appropriately as nodes desire for the certificate name changes.\n\n### letsencryptaws::import_keystore\n\nThis recipe takes certificates and imports them into a Java keystore.\n\n## Attributes\n\n### letsencryptaws::default\n\nFor certificate retrieval, just specify what certificates you would like by common name\nof the certificate and an array of Subject Alternative Names for the cert. The certificate\nmay have additional SANs if other nodes request them for the same common name.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Key</th>\n    <th>Type</th>\n    <th>Description</th>\n    <th>Default</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><tt>['letsencryptaws']['certs']</tt></td>\n    <td>Hash</td>\n    <td>keys are the common name, values are an array of strings that are the SANs for the cert.
