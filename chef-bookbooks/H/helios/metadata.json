  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nThe Greek god of the sun, Helios, was responsible for turning darkness into light.  In a similar fashion, SSL Certificates are designed to bring the bright light of verified identity to the darkest corners of the internet.  Unfortunately, they can also be a PIA to manage.\n\nHelios is designed to download certificates from remote URLs and import them into the appropriate Windows Certificate Store.\n\n** NO SSL CERTIFICATE VERIFICATION PERFORMED **\n\nHelios is simply a retreval-and-deployment tool, not any type of trust-verification engine.  If you point it at a valid certfile file, it will import it and your machine will begin trusting.  BE CAREFUL.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nWindows OS, powershell cookbook (which requires windows cookbook, which requires chef_handler cookbook)\n\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\n[:helios][:ca] is an array of hashes, one per certificate authority name, listing the types of certificates to retrieve and install.  [:helios][:{root,intermediate}][:name] is a hash of filenames and url locations to download the certs from.  It would be simple enough to change this construction into a data bag lookup.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nAdd your relevant 3rdparty cert providers to the [:ca] array, and then add their various certificate types.\n\nThis cookbook has been tested and verified working on Windows 2003 i386, Windows 2008 i386, and Windows 2008 R2 x86_64",
