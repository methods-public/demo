Rulesets included in the OS auditd/audit package as examples are based on 4 established standards:\n\n- [Controlled Access Protection Profile (CAPP)](http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/capp.pdf)\n- [Labeled Security Protection Profile (LSPP)](http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/lspp.pdf)\n- [National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM)](http://www.fas.org/sgp/library/nispom.htm)\n- [Security Technical Implementation Guides](http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/stig/index.html)\n\nThe OS package provides the client side tools for working with the linux kernel audit framework.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Platforms\n\n- Debian/Ubuntu\n- RHEL/CentOS/Scientific/Amazon/Oracle 6+\n\n### Chef\n\n- Chef 12.7+\n\n### Cookbooks\n\n- none\n\n## Attributes\n\n- node['auditd']['ruleset'] - ruleset to use, either \"default\" (the default if unset) or one of the provided examples\n- node['auditd']['backlog'] - backlog size, default is 320 should be larger for busy systems\n\n# Usage\n\nIf you're using one of the default rulesets set the correct attribute based on the ruleset desired, one of:\n\n- \"capp\" : Controlled Access Protection Profile\n- \"lspp\" : Labeled Security Protection Profile\n- \"nispom\" : National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM)\n- \"stig\" : Security Technical Implementation Guides\n- \"cis\" : Center for Internet Security auditd recommendations\n\nAnd include `recipe[auditd::rules]` in your run list. You can also set the attribute `node['auditd']['ruleset']` to the name of a custom rule template to be used instead of one of the default rules.\n\nIf you are using the recipe from a wrapper cookbook, include the default recipe `recipe[auditd]` to setup the service and use the `auditd_ruleset` resource to place your rule template of choice.\n\nIf you are not satisfied with any of the provided templates, you can specify the `cookbook` attribute in `auditd_ruleset` to use your own set of rules. In this case, do not include `recipe[auditd::rules]`.\n\nUse the `auditd::remove` recipe to uninstall auditd.\n\n## License & Authors\n\n**Author:** Cookbook Engineering Team ([cookbooks@chef.io](mailto:cookbooks@chef.io))\n\n**Copyright:** 2016, Chef Software, Inc.\n\n```\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.","maintainer":"Chef Software, Inc.","maintainer_email":"cookbooks@chef.io","license":"Apache-2.0","platforms":{"redhat":">= 0.0.0","ubuntu":">= 0.0.0","fedora":">= 0.0.0","centos":">= 0.0.0","scientific":">= 0.0.0","oracle":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"source_url":"https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/auditd","issues_url":"https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/auditd/issues","chef_version":[[">= 12.7"]],"ohai_version":[]}
