ACME cookbook
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/schubergphilis/chef-acme.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/schubergphilis/chef-acme)
[![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/acme.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/acme)

Automatically get/renew free and trusted certificates from Let's Encrypt (letsencrypt.org).
ACME is the [Automated Certificate Management Environment protocol][1] used by [Let's Encrypt][2].

```
Starting with v4.0.0 of the acme cookbook the acme_ssl_certificate provider has been removed! The TLS-SNI-01 validation method used by this provider been disabled by Let's Encrypt due to security concerns. Please switch to the acme_certificate provider in this cookbook to request and renew your certificate using the supported HTTP-01 validation method.
```

Recipes
-------
### default
Installs the required acme-client rubygem.

Usage
-----
Use the `acme_certificate` resource to request a certificate with the http-01 challange. The webserver for the domain for which you are requesting a certificate must be running on the local server. This resource only supports the http validation method. To use the tls-sni-01 challange, please see the resource below. Provide the path to your `wwwroot` for the specified domain.

```ruby
acme_certificate 'test.example.com' do
  crt               '/etc/ssl/test.example.com.crt'
  chain             '/etc/ssl/test.example.com-chain.crt'
  key               '/etc/ssl/test.example.com.key'
  wwwroot           '/var/www'
end
```

In case your webserver needs an already existing certificate when installing a new server you will have a bootstrap problem. Webserver cannot start without certificate, but the certificate cannot be requested without the running webserver. To overcome this a self-signed certificate can be generated with the `acme_selfsigned` resource.

```ruby
acme_selfsigned 'test.example.com' do
  crt     '/etc/ssl/test.example.com.crt'
  chain   '/etc/ssl/test.example.com-chain.crt'
  key     '/etc/ssl/test.example.com.key'
end
```


A working example can be found in the included `acme_client` test cookbook.

Example
-------
To generate a certificate for an apache2 website you can use code like this:

```ruby
# Include the recipe to install the gems
include_recipe 'acme'

# Set up contact information. Note the mailto: notation
node.override['acme']['contact'] = ['mailto:me@example.com']
# Real certificates please...
node.override['acme']['endpoint'] = 'https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org'

site = "example.com"
sans = ["www.#{site}"]

# Generate a self-signed if we don't have a cert to prevent bootstrap problems
acme_selfsigned "#{site}" do
  crt     "/etc/httpd/ssl/#{site}.crt"
  key     "/etc/httpd/ssl/#{site}.key"
  chain    "/etc/httpd/ssl/#{site}.pem"
  owner   "apache"
  group   "apache"
  notifies :restart, "service[apache2]", :immediate
end

# Set up your webserver here...

# Get and auto-renew the certificate from Let's Encrypt
acme_certificate "#{site}" do
  crt               "/etc/httpd/ssl/#{site}.crt"
  key               "/etc/httpd/ssl/#{site}.key"
  chain             "/etc/httpd/ssl/#{site}.pem"
  wwwroot           "/var/www/#{site}/htdocs/"
  notifies :restart, "service[apache2]"
  alt_names sans
end
```
