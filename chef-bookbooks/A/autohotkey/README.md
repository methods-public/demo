# autohotkey cookbook

This cookbook automates the installation of AutoHotkey.

AutoHotkey is a free, open-source utility for Windows. With it, you can:

Automate almost anything by sending keystrokes and mouse clicks. You
can write a mouse or keyboard macro by hand or use the macro recorder.

Create hotkeys for keyboard, joystick, and mouse. Virtually any key,
button, or combination can become a hotkey.

Expand abbreviations as you type them. For example, typing "btw" can
automatically produce "by the way".

Create custom data-entry forms, user interfaces, and menu bars. See
GUI for details.

Remap keys and buttons on your keyboard, joystick, and mouse.

Respond to signals from hand-held remote controls via the WinLIRC
client script.

Run existing AutoIt v2 scripts and enhance them with new
capabilities.

Convert any script into an EXE file that can be run on computers
that don't have AutoHotkey installed.
