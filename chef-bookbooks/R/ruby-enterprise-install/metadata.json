You should migrate off it as soon as you can. This cookbook is here to help you do that by\ninstalling REE onto newer OS versions of Ubuntu, CentOS, and Fedora. It's based off the no longer maintained\ncookbook ruby_enterprise (https://github.com/miketheman/ruby_enterprise).\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n## Cookbooks:\n* `build-essential` - get a compiler and associated files\n* `apt` - package manager for Ubuntu\n* `yum` - package manager for CentOS and Fedora\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\n* `node['ruby_enterprise']['install_path']` - Location to install REE. Default /opt/ruby-enterprise\n* `node['ruby_enterprise']['version']` - Version to install. Looks like `1.8.7-2012.02`\n* `node['ruby_enterprise']['url']` - URL to download. Default is from GoogleCode, with the version specified\n\nUsage\n=====\nInclude the ruby-enterprise-install recipe to install REE.\n\n    include_recipe \"ruby-enterprise-install\"\n\nOr add it to your role, or directly to a node's recipes.\n\nInstall RubyGems under REE with the ree_gem definition.\n\n    ree_gem \"rails\" do\n      source \"http://gems.rubyforge.org\"\n      version \"2.3.4\"\n    end\n\nThe definition supports parameters for source and version, though they are optional.\n\nNote\n====\nRuby Enterprise Edition has been dropped.\nA [post from Phusion][1] explains the reason for dropping the support.\nThis cookbook serves as a way to install REE onto new versions of infrastructure.\n\n[1]: http://blog.phusion.nl/2012/02/21/ruby-enterprise-edition-1-8-7-2012-02-released-end-of-life-imminent/\n\nLicense and Authors\n===================\n\nAuthor:: Bryan Crossland ([bacrossland](https://github.com/bacrossland))\nAuthor:: Mike Fiedler (<miketheman@gmail.com>)\nAuthor:: Joshua Timberman (<joshua@opscode.com>)\nAuthor:: Sean Cribbs (<seancribbs@gmail.com>)\nAuthor:: Michael Hale (<mikehale@gmail.com>)\n\nCopyright:: 2015, Bryan Crossland\nCopyright:: 2011-2012, Mike Fiedler\nCopyright:: 2009-2010, Opscode, Inc.\nCopyright:: 2009, Sean Cribbs\nCopyright:: 2009, Michael Hale\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n",
