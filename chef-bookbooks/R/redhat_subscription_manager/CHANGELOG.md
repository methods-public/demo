# redhat_subscription_manager Cookbook CHANGELOG

This file is used to list changes made in each version of the redhat_subscription_manager cookbook.

## 1.0.3 (2018-04-06)

- The resources in this cookbook now ship as part of Chef 14\. This cookbook is now deprecated and no further updates will be made. We highly recommend you update to Chef 14 and submit and issues you find to the Chef github repo at <https://github.com/chef/chef>

## 1.0.3 (2018-04-05)

- Fix username/password based registration

## 1.0.2 (2018-02-14)

- Fix only_if for katello-agent install in the register resource
- Update disable action text for the execute resource in the repo resource
- Updated the register resource to install subscription-manager which may be missing
- Simplified logic around activation_key property in the register resource
- Added native property validation to errata_level property in errata_level resource

## 1.0.1 (2018-02-06)

- Resolve a Chef 14 deprecation warning in rhsm_subscription resource

## 1.0.0 (2018-01-29)

- Removed the dependency on the compat_resource cookbook and instead require Chef 12.7 or later. This also fixes issues with running this cookbook on more recent Chef releases where compat_resource is no longer functional.
- Resolved multiple Chef 14 deprecation errors
- Don't try to install the katello package unless we've specified a sat host. This fixes using the public sat endpoint
- Skip all the katello agent download logic not just the remote file. This cleans up logs and speeds up Chef runs.
- Added redhat as a supported platform in the metadata
- Updated license strings to be SPDX compatible license strings
- Updated testing to use ChefDK and Delivery local mode. Gemfile / Rake testing has been removed
- Remove sensitive properly from the resource that wasn't necessary with Chef 12+
- Removed the ChefSpec matchers as these are autogenerated now by ChefSpec in current DK releases.
- Added contributing, testing, and license files
- Converted integration testing to inspec
