{"name":"repose","version":"3.5.0","description":"Installs/Configures repose","long_description":"# repose cookbook\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rackerlabs/cookbook-repose.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rackerlabs/cookbook-repose)\n\nThis cookbook installs, configures and manages Repose.\n\n\"REPOSE is an open-source RESTful HTTP proxy service that scales to the cloud. REPOSE provides the solution to common API processing tasks such as rate limiting, client authentication, versioning, and logging so that web service developers can focus on the unique features of their services.\" ~ http://openrepose.org/, 09/03/2013\n\n# Requirements\n\nSupports CentOS 6.5, Ubuntu 14.04, and Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nRequires Repose v6.2.0 or greater due to package differences.\n\n# Usage\n\nInclude `recipe[repose]` in your run_list and override attributes as required.\n\n## Filters\n\nThere are 2 ways to setup filters:\n  1. Include any of the `repose::filter-*` recipes *before* the `repose::default` recipe\n  2. Add the filter names to the `node['repose']['filters']` array\n\nAvailable filters are:\n  * [add-header](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/Add+Header+Filter)\n  * [api-validator](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/API+Validation+filter)\n  * [client-auth](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/Client+Authentication+filter) (deprecated in Repose 8.0.0 - replace with Keystone v2 Filter)\n  * [client-authorization](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/Client+Authorization+filter)\n  * [content-type-stripper](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/Content+Type+Stripper+filter) (system-model only)\n  * [CORS](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/CORS+filter)\n  * [DeRP](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/Delegation+Response+Processor+%28DeRP%29+Filter)\n  * [header-identity](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/Header+Identity+filter)\n  * [header-normalization](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/Header+Normalization+filter)\n  * [header-translation](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/Header+Translation+filter)\n  * [ip-identity](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/IP+Identity+filter) (deprecated in Repose 8.0.0 - replace with IP User Filter)\n  * [ip-user](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/IP+User+filter)\n  * [keystone-v2](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/Keystone+v2+Filter)\n  * [merge-header](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/Merge+Header+filter)\n  * [rackspace-auth-user](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/Rackspace+Auth+User+filter)\n  * [rate-limiting](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/Rate+Limiting+filter)\n  * [slf4j-http-logging](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/SLF4J+HTTP+Logging+filter)\n  * [translation](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/Translation+filter)\n  * [uri-identity](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/URI+Identity+filter)\n  * [uri-stripper](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/URI+Stripper+filter)\n  * [url-extractor-to-header](https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/URL+Extractor+to+Header)\n\nOther filters are available in Repose and may be added to this cookbook in a later revision.\n\n## Services\n\nServices work the same way as filters. Just s/filter/service/g.\n\nAvailable services are:\n  * [dist-datastore] (https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/Datastores#Datastores-distributedDistributedDatastore)\n  * [http-connection-pool] (https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/HTTP+Connection+Pool+service) (configuration only)\n  * [response-messaging] (https://repose.atlassian.net/wiki/display/REPOSE/Response+Messaging+service)\n  * [open-tracing] (http://www.openrepose.org/versions/latest/services/open-tracing.html)\n\n## Nodes\n\nThere are also 2 ways to setup nodes in `system-model.cfg.xml`:\n  1. Override the `node['repose']['peers']` array as shown below. Note that peers without a `cluster_id` are assumed to belong to all clusters. This is almost certainly not correct if more than 1 cluster is being configured but is implemented to maintain functionality with earlier versions of the cookbook.\n  2. Set `node['repose']['peer_search_enabled']` to `true`. For each Chef node found this way peers will be loaded according to the `node['repose']['cluster_ids']`, `node['repose']['node_id']`, `node['fqdn']`, `node['repose']['port']`, and `node['repose']['ssl_port']` attributes. `node_id` and `fqdn` will be consistant for each `cluster_id` in `cluster_ids`. `port` and `ssl_port` will be incremented by 1 for each `cluster_id` in `cluster_ids`.\n\n## Endpoints\n\nSetup endpoint in `system-model.cfg.xml` by overriding the `node['repose']['endpoints']` array as shown below. Note that endpoints without a `cluster_id` are assumed to belong to all clusters. This is almost certainly not correct if more than 1 cluster is being configured but is implemented to maintain functionality with earlier versions of the cookbook.\n\n# Attributes\n\n## General attributes\n\n* `node['repose']['owner']` - The Repose user. `root` on Ubuntu and `repose` on CentOS.\n* `node['repose']['group']` - The Repose primary group. `root` on Ubuntu and `repose` on CentOS.\n* `node['repose']['install_opts']` - Command line options used for installing pacakges.\n* `node['repose']['loglevel']` - The log level for the main Repose log file.\n* `node['repose']['cluster_ids']` - An array of cluster IDs.\n* `node['repose']['node_id']` - The node ID.\n* `node['repose']['port']` - The port to bind to.\n* `node['repose']['ssl_port']` - The SSL port to bind to.\n* `node['repose']['config_directory']` - Configuration directory location.\n* `node['repose']['log_path']` - Log directory location.\n* `node['repose']['pid_file']` - PID file location.\n* `node['repose']['java_opts']` - Java options specific to Repose.

To do so, add the <pre-authorized-roles> element to your configuration file as a child of the root element. This element will have <role> children elements which define the roles for which the tenant ID check does not occur. These roles will be compared to the roles returned in a token from the Keystone v2 service, and if there is a match, the project ID check will be skipped.\n```\npre_authorized_roles = ['observer','admin']\n```\n\n## client-auth attributes\n\n* `node['repose']['client_auth']['cluster_id']` - An array of cluster IDs that use this filter or `['all']` for all cluster IDs.\n* `node['repose']['client_auth']['auth_provider']` - The authentication provider to use, either 'RACKSPACE' for Rackspace cloud, or else 'OPENSTACK' for Keystone\n* `node['repose']['client_auth']['username_admin']` - Administrator username making auth-n requests for clients.\n* `node['repose']['client_auth']['password_admin']` - Administrator password making auth-n requests for clients.\n* `node['repose']['client_auth']['auth_uri']` - URI for the authentication service.\n* `node['repose']['client_auth']['tenanted']` - Whether the tenant_id will be parsed from the request uri.

You can also set an optional remove_attribute key if you'd like the original header to be removed.  to set the array.\n\nThe default headers are:\n```\n[\n  { 'original_name' => 'Content-Type',\n    'new_name' => 'rax-content-type'\n  },\n  { 'original_name' => 'Content-Length',\n    'new_name' => 'rax-content-length not-rax-content-length something-else',\n    'remove_original' => true\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## header-identity attributes\n\n* `node['repose']['header_identity']['cluster_id']` - An array of cluster IDs that use this filter or `['all']` for all cluster IDs.\n* `node['repose']['header_identity']['headers']` - Lists the headers to identify the incoming user.\n\nThe default headers are:\n```\n[\n  { 'id' => 'X-Auth-Token',\n    'quality' => 0.95\n  },\n  { 'id' => 'X-Forwarded-For',\n    'quality' => 0.5\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## header-normalization attributes\n\n* `node['repose']['header_normalization']['whitelist']` - a hash of whitelist blocks, each encapsulating an array of headers to be whitelisted by Repose for delivery to the origin service or next filter in the chain. A unique 'id' key identifies each whitelist entry, with optional 'uri_regex' and 'http_methods' keys to induce further constraints.\n* `node['repose']['header_normalization']['blacklist']` - a hash of blacklist blocks, each encapsulating an array of headers to be blacklisted by Repose for non-delivery to the origin service or next filter in the chain. A unique 'id' key identifies each blacklist entry, with optional 'uri_regex' and 'http_methods' keys to induce further constraints.\n\nThe default whitelist is:\n```\n[\n  { 'id' => 'credentials',\n    'uri_regex' => '/servers/(.*)',\n    'headers'   => ['X-Auth-Key','X-Auth-User']\n  },\n  { 'id' => 'modification',\n    'uri_regex' => '/resource/(.*)',\n    'http_methods' => 'PUT POST',\n    'headers'   => ['X-Modify']\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThe default blacklist is:\n```\n[\n  { 'id' => 'rate-limit-headers',\n    'headers'   => ['X-PP-User','X-PP-Groups']\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## merge-header attributes\n\n* `node['repose']['merge_header']['cluster_id']` - An array of cluster IDs that use this filter or `['all']` for all cluster IDs.\n* `node['repose']['merge_header']['response_headers']` - An array of response headers to merge into one\n* `node['repose']['merge_header']['request_headers']` - An array of response headers to merge into one\n\nThe default response_headers and request_headers are:\n```\n[]\n```\nwhich means no headers to merge and this filter becomes a no-op. An example to override it:\n```\nnode['repose']['merge_header']['response_headers'] = [\n    'HEADER1', 'HEADER2'\n]\nnode['repose']['merge_header']['request_headers'] = [\n    'HEADER1', 'HEADER2'\n]\n```\n\n## content-type-stripper attributes\n\n* `node['repose']['content_type_stripper']['cluster_id']` - An array of cluster IDs that use this filter or `['all']` for all cluster IDs.\n\n## CORS attributes\n\n* `node['repose']['cors']['cluster_id']` - An array of cluster IDs that use this filter or `['all']` for all cluster IDs.\n* `node['repose']['cors']['allowed_origins']` - An array of origin objects\n* `node['repose']['cors']['allowed_methods']` - An array of methods that are allowed to access origin service\n* `node['repose']['cors']['resources']` - An array of resource specific CORS that are allowed to be accessed.

An example configuration that overrides the default resources:\n```\nnode['repose']['cors']['resources'] = [\n  { 'path'            => '/resource1/.*',\n    'allowed_methods' => [\n      'GET'\n     ]\n  }\n]\n```\nwhich means only GET methods are allowed for CORS requests to \"/resource1/.*\"\n\n\n## http-connection-pool attributes\n\n* `node['repose']['http_connection_pool']['chunked_encoding']` - Use the default unless your programming language does not support chunked encoding. Some Repose filters modify request bodies. Due to this possibility Repose will, by default, send requests with entities as chunked. Setting chunked-encoding to false will cause Repose to attempt to evaluate the actual content length of the request by reading the ServletInputStream. Default is true.\n* `node['repose']['http_connection_pool']['max_total']` - Maximum number of connections that Repose opens across all endpoints. (If set too high, you might run out of memory.)

Default is 100.\n* `node['repose']['http_connection_pool']['connection_max_status_line_garbage']` - Maximum number of lines allotted for garbage. Default is 100.\n* `node['repose']['http_connection_pool']['tcp_nodelay']` - Default is true.\n* `node['repose']['http_connection_pool']['keepalive_timeout']` - If a Keep-Alive header is not present in the response, the value of keepalive.timeout is evaluated. If this value is 0, the connection will be kept alive indefinitely. If the value is greater than 0, the connection will be kept alive for the number of milliseconds specified. Set to 1 to connect:close. Default is 0.\n\n## translation attributes\n\n* `node['repose']['translation']['cluster_id']` - An array of cluster IDs that use this filter or `['all']` for all cluster IDs.\n* `node['repose']['translation']['allow_doctype_decl']` - If false, then any request/response body that contains an DOCTYPE section will be rejected.

May include all other recipes.\n\n## install\n\nInstall Repose only. Loads the appropriate install recipe based on platform family. This recipe is not meant to be used directly.\n\n## install_debian\n\nInstall Repose on the Debian family of systems. This recipe is not meant to be used directly.\n\n## install_rhel\n\nInstall Repose on the RHEL family of systems. This recipe is not meant to be used directly.\n\n## load_peers\n\nUses chef-search to find nodes with a matching Chef environment, search role, and cluster ID, maps them to hashes representing Repose peers, and loads them into the `node['repose']['peers']` array. Not meant to be called directly unless a different cookbook wants to find Repose nodes. E.g. maybe Nginx uses Repose nodes as a backend and wants to consume `node['repose']['peers']`.\n\n## filter-* or service-*\n\nSetup a paticular filter or service. *Must* be called before `repose::default`.\n\n# Vagrant\n\nThis cookbook includes support for Vagrant. Start the VM by following these steps\n\n1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)\n2. Install [Vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/)\n3. Run `bundle install`\n4. Run `vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf`\n5. Run `vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus`\n6. Run `vagrant up`\n\n# Tests\n\nThis cookbook includes support for test-kitchen and chefspec unit tests. Run the test suite with\n\n```\nkitchen test\n```\n\n# Author(s)\n\n* Author: Brendan ODonnell (<brendan.odonnell@rackspace.com>)\n* Author: Nick Silkey (<nick.silkey@rackspace.com>)\n* Author: Dimitry Ushakov  (<dimitry.ushakov@rackspace.com>)\n","maintainer":"Rackspace Hosting","maintainer_email":"cookbook-repose@rackspace.com","license":"All rights reserved","platforms":{"centos":">= 0.0.0","ubuntu":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{"apt":">= 0.0.0","yum":">= 0.0.0","yum-epel":">= 0.0.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"source_url":"https://github.com/rackerlabs/cookbook-repose","issues_url":"https://github.com/rackerlabs/cookbook-repose/issues","chef_version":[[">= 12"]],"ohai_version":[]}
