This cookbook uses a variety of testing components:

- Integration tests: [Test Kitchen](https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen)
- Chef Style lints: [Foodcritic](https://github.com/acrmp/foodcritic)
- Ruby Style lints: [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)

# Prerequisites

To develop on this cookbook, you must have a sane Ruby 1.9+ environment. Given the nature of this installation process (and it's variance across multiple operating systems), we will leave this installation process to the user.

You must also have `bundler` installed:

    $ gem install bundler

You must also have Vagrant and VirtualBox installed:

- [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com)
- [VirtualBox](https://virtualbox.org)

Once installed, you must install the `vagrant-berkshelf` plugin:

    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf
