Zookeeper Platform
==================

Description
-----------

Apache ZooKeeper is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source server
which enables highly reliable distributed coordination. Learn more about
ZooKeeper on <http://zookeeper.apache.org>.

This cookbook focuses on deploying a Zookeeper cluster via Chef.

Requirements
------------

### Cookbooks and gems

Declared in [metadata.rb](metadata.rb) and in [Gemfile](Gemfile).

### Platforms

A *systemd* managed distribution:
- RHEL Family 7, tested on Centos 7.2

Note: it should work fine on Debian 8 but the official docker image does not
allow systemd to work easily, so it could not be tested.

Usage
-----

### Easy Setup

Create a role `zookeeper-platform` having `recipe['zookeeper-platform']` in its
runlist and setting `node['zookeeper-platform']['role']` to itself. Add this
role in the runlists of the nodes you want to use for your cluster. By default,
you need exactly 3 nodes.

By default, this cookbook installs *openjdk* from the official repositories
*(openjdk 8 on centos 7)* in **systemd\_service** recipe, just before
launching the service. You can deactivate this behavior by setting
`node['zookeeper-platform']['java']` to `""`, or choose your package by setting
the package name in `node['zookeeper-platform']['java'][node[:platform]]`.

### Search

By default, the *config* recipe use a search to find the members of a cluster.
The search is parametrized by a role name, defined in attribute
`node['zookeeper-platform']['role']` which default to *zookeeper-platform*.
Node having this role in their expanded runlist will be considered in the same
zookeeper cluster. For safety reason, if search is used, you need to define
`node['zookeeper-platform']['size']` (3 by default). The cookbook will return
(with success) until the search return *size* nodes. This ensures the
stability of the configuration during the initial startup of a cluster.

If you do not want to use search, it is possible to define
`node['zookeeper-platform']['hosts']` with an array containing the hostnames of
the nodes of a zookeeper cluster. In this case, *size* attribute is ignored
and search deactivated.

### Test

This cookbook is fully tested through the installation of a working 3-nodes
cluster in docker hosts. This uses kitchen (>= 1.5.0), docker (>= 1.10) and
a small monkey-patch.

For more information, see *.kitchen.yml* and *test* directory.

### Local cluster

You can also use this cookbook to install a zookeeper cluster locally. By
running `kitchen converge`, you will have a 3-nodes cluster available on your
workstation, each in its own docker host. You can then access it with:

    zkCli.sh -server $(docker inspect \
      --format '{{.NetworkSettings.Networks.kitchen.IPAddress}}' \
      zookeeper-kitchen-01)

Attributes
----------

Configuration is done by overriding default attributes. All configuration keys
have a default defined in [attributes/default.rb](attributes/default.rb).
Please read it to have a comprehensive view of what and how you can configure
this cookbook behavior.

Recipes
-------

### default

Run *install*, *create\_user*, *config* and *systemd\_service* recipes, in that
order.

### install

Install zookeeper with *ark* cookbook.

### create\_user

Create zookeeper system user and group.

### config

Generate nodes list by search or by using hosts attribute. Merge it with base
configuration, then install *myid* and *zoo.cfg* files. Create work
directories: for data and logs.

### systemd\_service

Install zookeeper service for systemd, enable and start it. Install *java*
package by default.

Resources/Providers
