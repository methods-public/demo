{"name":"zfs_linux","version":"2.1.3","description":"Installs/Configures zfs on linux","long_description":"zfs\\_linux Cookbook\n==================\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/biola/chef-zfs_linux)\n\nInstalls & configures zfs on Ubuntu.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nUbuntu 12.04+\n\nUsage\n-----\n#### zfs\\_linux::default\nJust include `zfs_linux` in your node's `run_list`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\":\"my_node\",\n  \"run_list\": [\n    \"recipe[zfs_linux]\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### zfs\\_linux::auto-snapshot\nInstalls the zfs-auto-snapshot package, which automatically sets up rotating snapshots (hourly snapshots kept for a day, daily snapshots kept for a month, etc).\n\n#### zfs\\_linux::auto-scrub\nUses cron.d (via the cron cookbook) to setup cron jobs on Sunday morning for each zpool. If greater than 4 zpools are present, runs the checks once a month on the first Sunday.\n\n#### zfs\\_linux::source\nThis recipe was developed to allow the deployment of ZoL from a specific commit. Apply it to your node to pull down the ZFS revision from git (specified in your node's attributes).\n\n__WARNING:__ On Debian-family systems, the current build method will disable automatic updates for your kernel because the ZoL packages will be built for the kernel that is running at the time of compilation. Do not apply this without a process in place for monitoring security updates and applying them manually in the following manner:\n1. Update your system kernel packages\n2. Disable the auto-start of any services that depend on your ZoL-mounted volumes\n3. Reboot into the new kernel\n4. Delete the zfs & spl directories in /var/chef/cache/\n5. Perform a chef-client run\n6. Enable auto-start again for your node's services\n7. Reboot\n\nResources/Providers\n-----\n### zfs_linux_snapshot\n#### Actions\n\n- `:create`: Creates a snapshot of the dataset\n- `:prune`: Deletes a datasets snapshots down to a specified number of\n  snapshots\n- `:purge`: Deletes all snapshots for a dataset\n\n#### Attribute Parameters\n\n- `dataset`: Name of the zpool/fileset. Defaults to the resource name.\n- `prefix`: String to prefix the snapshot name. Defaults to `zfs-chef-snap`.\n  When pruning/purging snapshots, used to filter the list of snapshots\n  to be deleted (set to `nil` to disable the search filter).\n- `snaps_to_retain`: The number of snapshots to retain (only applies to\n  the `:prune` action). Defaults to `31`\n- `append_timestamp`: Boolean to determine whether a timestamp (in\n  the form of `-YY-MM-DD-HHmm`) is appended to the snapshot prefix.\n  Defaults to `true`\n\n#### Examples\n```ruby\n# Create a snapshot with a specific name\nzfs_linux_snapshot 'tank/mydataset' do\n  prefix 'myweeklysnapshot'\n  append_timestamp false\nend\n\n# Delete all snapshots that match 'weekly'\nzfs_linux_snapshot 'tank/mydataset' do\n  prefix 'weekly'\n  action :purge\nend\n\n# Remove all but the last 6 monthly snapshots\nzfs_linux_snapshot 'tank/mydataset' do\n  prefix 'zfs-auto-snap_monthly'\n  snaps_to_retain 6\n  action :prune\nend\n```\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n1. Fork the repository on Github\n2. Create a named feature branch (like `add_component_x`)\n3. Write your change\n4. Write tests for your change (if applicable)\n5. Run the tests, ensuring they all pass\n6.
