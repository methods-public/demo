# instana-agent Cookbook

This [Chef](https://chef.io) cookbook installs, configures and runs the monitoring agent for the [Instana monitoring suite](https://www.instana.com).

## Flavors

**`instana-agent-dynamic`**

This blank agent comes bundled with a JDK and is configured to download all neccessary sensors when it starts. Additionally, it is configured to update its set of sensors on a daily basis.

**`instana-agent-static`**

This "gated" agent package is supposed to not connect to the internet at all. It comes with all the recent sensors and a JDK, and is your package of choice when you run a tight firewall setup.

## Monitoring endpoint

If you're an onprem customer, please specify your hostname and port in the corresponding attributes. If you're using our SaaS offering, and don't know which endpoint the agent should send to, feel free to ask our sales team.

## Supported operating systems

See [our official documentation](https://docs.instana.com).
