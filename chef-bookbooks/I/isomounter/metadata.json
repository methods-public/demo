I have recently ensured that the binary \"miso.exe\" is downloaded as well to enable commandline functionality.\n\nhttp://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-history.htm\n\nhttp://searchwindowsserver.techtarget.com/tip/How-to-install-and-manage-virtual-CD-DVDs\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n[:platform] == \"windows\"  NOTE: something in chef 0.10.10 has broken this cookbook with Windows 2008 Datacenter Edition.  Backing Chef down to 0.10.6 or using the new opscode windows installer seems to solve the issue.  Strange.\n\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\nMost of the attributes simply refer to the version of Magic Disc.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nCommand line usage:\n\nmiso.exe NULL -sdrv 0\nDisable all virtual Drives.\n\nmiso.exe NULL -vlist\nList all of the present virtual CD/DVD driver\n\nmiso.exe NULL -mnt f: e:\\en_sql_server_2008_r2_standard_x86_x64_ia64_dvd_521546.iso\nMount the MSSQL iso located inside the root of the e:\\ drive to virtual drive f:\n\nmiso NULL -umnt f:\nUnmount virtual drive f:\n",
