  "long_description": "\nDescription\n===========\n\nInstalls netatalk with SSL support, for compatibility with newer\nversions of Mac OS X.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nTested on the following platforms using test-kitchen (converges clean,\nOS X 10.8 client can connect).\n\n* Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04\n* Debian 6.0\n* CentOS 6.5\n* Fedora 20\n\nPreviously working, but untested:\n\n* ArchLinux\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\nAttributes are documented in the cookbook's metadata.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThe default netatalk package on Debian/Ubuntu does not have SSL\nsupport, so newer Mac OS X clients will be unable to authenticate.\nNetatalk 2.2 is required, or the package needs to be built from source\nwith SSL.\n\nGenerally, include the default recipe on the node's run list. On older\nversions of Ubuntu/Debian, the backport PPA with Netatalk 2.2 will be\nenabled. If this is not working in your Ubuntu/Debian nodes, set the\n`node['netatalk']['package_recipe']` attribute to `build_deb` and the\npackage will be built from the deb-src. The build_deb recipe will\ninstall the build dependencies to use debuild to build the netatalk\npackage. This does take quite some time to build.\n\nThe shares do need to be configured, and you can set up the attributes\nin a role, e.g. \"netatalk_server\" with default or override attributes:\n\n    \"netatalk\" => {\n      \"share_base\" => \"/srv/export\",\n      \"share_base_owner\" => \"jtimberman\",\n      \"share_base_group\" => \"jtimberman\",\n      \"shares\" => [\n        '~/ \"Home Directory\"',\n        '/srv/export/timemachine \"TimeMachine\" allow:jtimberman cnidscheme:cdb'\n      ]\n    }\n\nTo modify the options used in `/etc/netatalk/afpd.conf`, set the\n`node['netatalk']['afpd_options']` with the entire string as the\noptions line that should appear in the configuration file.\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\n- Author:: Joshua Timberman <opensource@housepub.org>\n- Copyright 2009-2013, Joshua Timberman\n- Copyright 2009-2012, Opscode, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
