{"name":"snort","version":"3.0.0","description":"Installs Snort IDS packages","long_description":"# snort Cookbook\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sous-chefs/snort.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sous-chefs/snort) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/snort.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/snort)\n\nInstalls the SNORT IDS daemon.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Platforms\n\n- Ubuntu 14.04+\n- RHEL/CentOS, 7.0 and higher only.\n- Fedora\n- Debian 8\n\n### Chef\n\n- Chef 12.1+\n\n## Resources\n\n### Install\n\n- On Ubuntu systems, the packages from apt are used.\n- On RHEL and Fedora systems, the packages are retrieved directly from the SNORT project site.\n- On Debian the test recipe forces a compiled install.\n\n### Config\n\nConfigures `/etc/snort/snort.conf`. We recommend you put your own config in disk using the file resource.\n\n### Rules\n\nDownloads rules for snort.\n\n### Service\n\nUsed to setup the `snort_service` for use in other resources.\n\n## Usage\n\nAn example usage pattern can be found in the test cookbook.\n\n- Use the `snort_install` to install the package. This also creates the `snort_service` resource which you can use to stop, start & enable the snort service correctly.\n\nRHEL based systems you _must_ use the following resources (optional on Debian based systems).\n\n- Use `snort_config` to configure the system.\n- Use `snort_rules` to install rules. You will need a licence for this.\n\nExample configs can be found in `test/fixtures/cookbooks/test/`\n\n## References\n\n- [SNORT home page](http://www.snort.org)\n\n## License\n\n- Copyright 2017, Webb Agile Solutions Ltd.\n- Copyright 2015-2016, Cozy Services Ltd.\n- Copyright 2010-2016, Chef Software, Inc.\n\n```\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n","maintainer":"Sous Chefs","maintainer_email":"help@sous-chefs.org","license":"Apache-2.0","platforms":{"ubuntu":">= 0.0.0","debian":">= 0.0.0","redhat":">= 0.0.0","centos":">= 0.0.0","fedora":">= 0.0.0","scientific":">= 0.0.0","amazon":">= 0.0.0","oracle":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{"yum-epel":">= 0.0.0","compat_resource":">= 12.19","poise-archive":">= 0.0.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"source_url":"https://github.com/sous-chefs/snort","issues_url":"https://github.com/sous-chefs/snort/issues","chef_version":[[">= 12.5"]],"ohai_version":[]}
