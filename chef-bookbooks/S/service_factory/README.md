# service_factory cookbook

Cookbook for Opscode Chef.

http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/service_factory

**Fully functional â€¦ documentation WIP, and example usages coming soon !!**


# Description

Generate services using native system features with the **service_factory** LWRPs.

Your recipe provides the configuration details, and the necessary files are generated to create a **SysV** or **Upstart** service, depending on what each OS prefers. (**SystemD** coming soon!!)

**Supported Service Managers**

- SysV (init.d, chkconfig, etc.)
- Upstart (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)

**Supported Operating Systems**
The following are supported and verified through test-kitchen automated integration testing.

- Centos
- Ubuntu

**Default Service Managers**

Unless otherwise specified in the **service_factory** global config, the default service manager is **SysV**, and
others are selected conditionally based on the distribution and version.

You can customize these defaults by adjusting the 'platform_map' node attribute, described below.


# Requirements

Cookbooks:: [unix_bin](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/service_factory) , [resource_masher](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/resource_masher) , [run_action_now](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/run_action_now)

Resource attributes:: `service_desc` , `exec` , `run_user` , `run_group`


# Simple Examples (More coming soon..)

*There is a full attribute listing towards end of README.*

** Basic service (required elements) **

    service_factory "my_service" do
      service_desc "My Service"
      exec "/opt/myapp/bin/run.sh"
      run_user "nobody"
      run_group "nobody"
      action :create                  # can also :enable and :start here, use array
    end
    
** Service with arguments or environment variables **

    service_factory "my_service" do
      service_desc "My Service"
      exec "/opt/myapp/bin/run.sh"
      exec_args "--port 1234"         # can also be an array of strings
      env_variables({                 # variables must be in a hash
        :SERVICE_VARIABLE => "value"
      })
      run_user "nobody"
      run_group "nobody"
      action :create
    end
    
** Forked service **

It's really import to set the proper flag if the service forks.
(Meaning that the script you're calling returns immediately and the service runs in the background.)

    service_factory "my_service" do
      service_desc "My Service"
      exec "/opt/myapp/bin/run.sh"
      exec_forks true
      pid_file "/opt/myapp/var/run/myapp.pid"
      run_user "nobody"
      run_group "nobody"
      action :create
    end
    
** Notifications **

The service_factory resource can receive all standard service signals. It also creates a stock service resource you can notify as well.

    some_resource "abc" do
      notifies :start, "service_factory[my_service]"
    end
    
    some_resource "abc" do
      notifies :start, "service[my_service]"
    end


# Resource Documentation

**RESOURCE ACTIONS**

    :create , :delete , :start , :stop , :restart , :enable , :disable

**Note:** You can also use a standard Chef service resource to manage the service once created.

# Recipes

This cookbook only provides LWRPs, no recipes are included.


# Attributes

The following default node attributes govern the platform selection.
You may customize the operation by appending/overwriting these in your node configuration.

- `default["service_factory"]["platform_map"]["default"] = "init"`
- `default["service_factory"]["platform_map"]["ubuntu"]["default"] = "upstart"`


# Test-Kitchen

This package is **test-kitchen** enabled and automatically tested against:

- CentOS 5 and 6
- Ubuntu 10 and 12

A successful test appears as follows:

    -----> Running bats test suite
           1..6
           ok 1 non-forked service
           ok 2 forked service
           ok 3 sighup restart (non-forked)
           ok 4 sighup restart (forked)
           ok 5 nobody service
           ok 6 deleted service
           Finished verifying <default-ubuntu-1004> (1m18.10s).
