  "long_description": "# Description\n\nAdds [Data Bag][data_bag] support for older versions of *chef-solo*.\n\n# Requirements\n\n## Chef\n\nChef versions lower than 0.10.4 may benefit. There is no reason to use this\ncookbook for Chef version 0.10.4 and higher as the feature is part of the\ncore.\n\n## Platform\n\nTested on Mac OS X 10.6.8 and Ubuntu 10.10 but should work any platform\nthat is supported by Chef.\n\n## Cookbooks\n\nThere are no external cookbook dependencies.\n\n# Installation\n\nDepending on the situation and use case there are several ways to install\nthis cookbook. All the methods listed below assume a tagged version release\nis the target, but omit the tags to get the head of development. A valid\nChef repository structure like the [Opscode repo][chef_repo] is also assumed.\n\n## From the Opscode Community Platform\n\nTo install this cookbook from the Opscode platform, use the *knife* command:\n\n    knife cookbook site install solo_data_bags\n\n## Using Librarian\n\nThe [Librarian][librarian] gem aims to be Bundler for your Chef cookbooks.\nInclude a reference to the cookbook in a **Cheffile** and run\n`librarian-chef install`. To install with Librarian:\n\n    gem install librarian\n    cd chef-repo\n    librarian-chef init\n    cat >> Cheffile <<END_OF_CHEFFILE\n    cookbook 'solo_data_bags',\n      :git => 'git://github.com/fnichol/chef-solo_data_bags.git', :ref => 'v0.0.4'\n    END_OF_CHEFFILE\n    librarian-chef install\n\n## Using knife-github-cookbooks\n\nThe [knife-github-cookbooks][kgc] gem is a plugin for *knife* that supports\ninstalling cookbooks directly from a GitHub repository. To install with the\nplugin:\n\n    gem install knife-github-cookbooks\n    cd chef-repo\n    knife cookbook github install fnichol/chef-solo_data_bags/v0.0.4\n\n## As a Git Submodule\n\nA common practice (which is getting dated) is to add cookbooks as Git\nsubmodules. This is accomplishes like so:\n\n    cd chef-repo\n    git submodule add git://github.com/fnichol/chef-solo_data_bags.git cookbooks/solo_data_bags\n    git submodule init && git submodule update\n\n**Note:** the head of development will be linked here, not a tagged release.\n\n## As a Tarball\n\nIf the cookbook needs to downloaded temporarily just to be uploaded to a Chef\nServer or Opscode Hosted Chef, then a tarball installation might fit the bill:\n\n    cd chef-repo/cookbooks\n    curl -Ls https://github.com/fnichol/chef-solo_data_bags/tarball/v0.0.4 | tar xfz - && \\\n      mv fnichol-chef-solo_data_bags-* solo_data_bags\n\n# Usage\n\nSimply include the cookbook in your chef repository and\n`libraries/solo_data_bags` will be loaded in the chef-solo run to add Data\nBag support.\n\n# Recipes\n\n## default\n\nThis recipe is a no-op and does nothing.\n\n# Attributes\n\nThere are no attributes to define or configure.\n\n# Development\n\n* Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]\n* Report issues/Questions/Feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]\n\nPull requests are very welcome! Make sure your patches are well tested.\nIdeally create a topic branch for every separate change you make.\n\n# License and Author\n\nAuthor:: Fletcher Nichol (<fnichol@nichol.ca>)\n\nCopyright 2011, Fletcher Nichol\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n[chef_repo]:  https://github.com/opscode/chef-repo\n[data_bag]:   http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Data+Bags\n[kgc]:        https://github.com/websterclay/knife-github-cookbooks#readme\n[librarian]:  https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian#readme\n\n[repo]:     https://github.com/fnichol/chef-solo_data_bags\n[issues]:   https://github.com/fnichol/chef-solo_data_bags/issues\n",
