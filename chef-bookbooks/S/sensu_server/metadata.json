  "long_description": "# sensu_server cookbook\n\nA wrapper around the sensu cookbook to install & setup a sensu-server.\n\nSee [sensuapp.com](http://sensuapp.com/) for more information about Sensu.\n\n\n# Requirements\n\n**sensu cookbook** - [https://github.com/sensu/sensu-chef](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-chef)\n\n\n# Usage\n\nIf you are using SSL (recommended), you need to have the ssl certificates in a databag. A script is provided [with the sensu-chef cookbook](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-chef/tree/master/examples/ssl) to do this.\n\nIf you are using Chef Server (or Hosted Chef), you should do this on your workstation (where knife is setup):\n\n    git clone https://github.com/sensu/sensu-chef.git\n    cd sensu-chef/examples/ssl\n    ./ssl_certs.sh generate\n    knife data bag create sensu\n    knife data bag from file sensu ssl.json\n    ./ssl_certs.sh clean\n\nIf you are using Chef Solo, you can follow the instructions above, but instead of the \"knife data bag\" commands, you should create a sensu directory under the directory you configured as \"data_bag_path\" in your solo.rb file and copy the ssl.json file into it. If you are using Chef Solo with Vagrant, you can set the data_bag_path using:\n\n    config.vm.provision \"chef_solo\" do |chef|\n      chef.data_bags_path = \"data_bags\"\n    end\n\nIf you are not using SSL (not recommended), you need to set [:sensu][:rabbitmq][:user_ssl] to false (see below).\n\nOnce you have the SSL certificates in place (or SSL disabled), include default recipe in your run list.\n\nYou can do this by including it as a dependancy (in metadata.rb) in your wrapper cookbook and using: include_recipe 'sensu_server', or by including sensu_server in a role or node's run list.\n\n\n# Attributes\n\nYou can set any of the sensu attributes detailed [in the README for the sensu cookbook](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-chef/blob/master/README.md).\n\nFor example, if you wanted to turn off SSL (not recommend), then you could do this:\n\nIn a recipe:\n\n    node.override[:sensu][:use_ssl] = false\n\nIn an attributes file:\n\n    override[:sensu][:use_ssl] = false\n\n\n# Recipes\n\n**default** - install rabbitmq, redis + sensu and setup the server, api and dashboard services.\n\n\n# Author\n\nAuthor:: Ian Chilton (<ian@ichilton.co.uk>)\n",
