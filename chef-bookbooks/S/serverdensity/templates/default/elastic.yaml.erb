  # The URL where elasticsearch accepts HTTP requests. This will be used to
  # fetch statistics from the nodes and information about the cluster health.
  #
  # If you're using basic authentication with a 3rd party library, for example
  # elasticsearch-http-basic, you will need to specify a value for username
  # and password for every instance that requires authentication.
  #
  # If your cluster is hosted externally (i.e., you're not pointing to localhost)
  # you will need to set `cluster_stats` to true otherwise the check will only
  # submit metrics of the local node.
  #
  # If you enable the "pshard_stats" flag, statistics over primary shards
  # will be collected by the check and sent to the backend with the
  # 'elasticsearch.primary' prefix. It is particularly useful if you want to
  # get certain metrics without taking replicas into account. For instance,
  # 'elasticsearch.primaries.docs.count` will give you the total number of
  # documents in your indexes WITHOUT counting duplicates due to the existence
  # of replica shards in your ES cluster

  # `pending_task_stats` (defaults to True) specifies whether to collect data exposed
  # by the `pending_tasks` cluster endpoint
  # Ref: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-pending.html
  # Some managed ElasticSearch services (e.g. AWS ElasticSearch) do not expose this endpoint.
  # Set `pending_task_stats` to false if you use such a service.
