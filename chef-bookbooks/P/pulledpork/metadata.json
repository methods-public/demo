The default attributes of this cookbook assume the snort paths from a package install as done in the snort cookbook. If you install via source you'll want to set these attributes to the source paths.\n\nYou will need to set the rule_url_array attribute for pulledpork to run. The attribute defaults to nil to give full control over the rules you run. The Kitchen CI setup uses '<https://s3.amazonaws.com/snort-org/www/rules/community/|community-rules.tar.gz|Community>' which provides open source community rules.\n\n## License & Authors\n\n**Author:** Tim Smith ([tsmith84@gmail.com](mailto:tsmith84@gmail.com))\n\n**Copyright:** 2015-2016, Tim Smith\n\n```\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n","maintainer":"Tim Smith","maintainer_email":"tsmith84@gmail.com","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"debian":">= 7.0","ubuntu":">= 12.04","redhat":">= 0.0.0","centos":">= 0.0.0","scientific":">= 0.0.0","amazon":">= 0.0.0","oracle":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{"ark":">= 0.0.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{}}
