  "long_description": "Prometheus Platform\n===================\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nPrometheus is an Open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally\nbuilt at SoundCloud.\n\nThis cookbook is designed to install and configure Prometheus with its\nAlertmanager and all exporters listed on [https://prometheus.io/download]().\nOthers, specific exporters are out of the scope of this cookbook.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n### Cookbooks and gems\n\nDeclared in [metadata.rb](metadata.rb) and in [Gemfile](Gemfile).\n\n### Platforms\n\nShould works on every Linux distro managed by systemd, possibly with minor\nadjustments. Tested on CentOS 7.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n### Test\n\nThis cookbook is tested through the installation of 2 nodes in docker hosts:\n\n- a master with Prometheus server, Alertmanager, Pushgateway, Node exporter and\n  Statsd exporter\n- a worker with Node exporter and Statsd exporter.\n\nThis uses kitchen, docker and some monkey-patching.\n\nFor more information, see *.kitchen.yml* and *test* directory.\n\nAttributes\n----------\n\nConfiguration is done by overriding default attributes. All configuration keys\nhave a default defined in:\n\n[attributes/default.rb](attributes/default.rb).\n\nPlease read it to have a comprehensive view of what and how you can configure\nthis cookbook behavior.\n\nYou can also look at the role written for the tests to have an example on how\nto configure this cookbook:\n[server](test/integration/roles/prometheus-platform-server.json) and\n[node](test/integration/roles/prometheus-platform.json).\n\nRecipes\n-------\n\n### default\n\nInclude all others recipes.\n\n### user\n\nCreate user/group used by Prometheus\n\n### install\n\nInstall all components with sub-attribute 'install?' as true.\n\n### scrapers\n\nPrepare scrape\\_configs configuration from scrapers attributes. Use\ncluster-search to create a dynamic \"static\\_configs\".\n\n### config\n\nGenerate and deploy configuration for all components.\n\nAlso generate the alerting and recording rules for Prometheus.\n\n### service\n\nDeploy systemd units for all components.\n\nResources/Providers\n-------------------\n\nNone.\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\nAvailable in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPlease read carefully [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a merge\nrequest.\n\nLicense and Author\n------------------\n\n- Author:: Samuel Bernard (<samuel.bernard@gmail.com>)\n- Author:: Florian Philippon (<florian.philippon@gmail.com>)\n\n```text\nCopyright (c) 2016-2017 Sam4Mobile, 2017-2018 Make.org\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
