  "long_description": "This cookbook was written primarily to automate several steps I often have to do in recipes:\n\n+ Fetch some archive\n+ Extract it somewhere\n+ Symlink it elsewhere\n\nAll these steps are wrapped in a neat LWRP.\n\n## Supported archive types\n\n- gzip\n\n## Usage\n\nSee the ```test.rb``` recipe for examples.\n\n## LWRP options\n\n+ ```archive_type```: gzip\n+ ```download_to```: By default, to Chef's temp download directory. Can be changed to wherever.\n+ ```extract```: defaults to ```true```\n+ ```extract_to```: where to unpack the archive\n+ ```strip```: defaults to ```true```. Remove the first-level directory from the archive.\n+ ```symlink```: defaults to ```true```\n+ ```symlink_to```: where to symlink it\n\n## Contributing\n1. Fork the repository on Github\n2. Create a named feature branch (like `add_component_x`)\n3. Write you change\n4. Write tests for your change (if applicable)\n5. Run the tests, ensuring they all pass\n6.
