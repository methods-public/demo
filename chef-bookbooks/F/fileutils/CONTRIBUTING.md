some notes about contributions.

## Code of Conduct.

## Tests

Most of the code for this cookbook involves extensive file manipulations. Unit tests in the form of rspec tests
make sense for the logic only methods.  Serverspec integration tests were written for testing code that 
manipulates files.

Pull requests should include.
* Reqression tests for bug fixes
* Functional tests for new features

## Branches
