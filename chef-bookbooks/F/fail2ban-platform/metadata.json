  "long_description": "Fail2Ban Platform Cookbook\n==========================\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nFail2ban scans log files (e.g. /var/log/apache/error\\_log) and bans IPs that\nshow the malicious signs -- too many password failures, seeking for exploits,\netc. Generally Fail2Ban is then used to update firewall rules to reject the\nIP addresses for a specified amount of time, although any arbitrary other\naction (e.g. sending an email) could also be configured. Out of the box\nFail2Ban comes with filters for various services (apache, courier, ssh, etc).\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n### Cookbooks and gems\n\nDeclared in [metadata.rb](metadata.rb) and in [Gemfile](Gemfile).\n\n### Platforms\n\nA *systemd* managed distribution, tested on:\n\n- RHEL Family 7, tested on Centos\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n### Test\n\nThis cookbook is fully tested through the installation of a Fail2Ban server in\ndocker hosts. This uses kitchen and docker.\n\nFor more information, see [.kitchen.yml](.kitchen.yml) and [test](test)\ndirectory.\n\nAttributes\n----------\n\nConfiguration is done by overriding default attributes. All configuration keys\nhave a default defined in [attributes/default.rb](attributes/default.rb).\nPlease read it to have a comprehensive view of what and how you can configure\nthis cookbook behavior.\n\nRecipes\n-------\n\n### default\n\nInclude `package`, `config`, `systemd` recipes.\n\n### package\n\nInstall **Fail2Ban** using package.\n\n### config\n\nGenerate and deploy **Fail2Ban** configuration overrides\nin following directories if needed:\n - */etc/fail2ban/action.d*\n - */etc/fail2ban/filters.d*\n - */etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.d*\n - */etc/fail2ban/jail.d*\n\n### systemd\n\nEnable Fail2Ban and make sure service is started.\n\nResources/Providers\n-------------------\n\nNone.\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\nAvailable in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPlease read carefully [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a merge\nrequest.\n\nLicense and Author\n------------------\n\n- Author:: Sylvain Arrambourg (<saye@sknss.net>)\n- Author:: Samuel Bernard (<samuel.bernard@gmail.com>)\n\n```text\nCopyright (c) 2018 Make.org\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n",
