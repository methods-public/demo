Other encryption options supported by `dm-crypt` as well as other features will be added in time.\n\n## Requirements\n\nRequires Chef 12.5 or later as this cookbook makes use of [Custom Resources](https://www.chef.io/blog/2015/10/08/chef-client-12-5-released/).\n\n## Usage\n\nYou always need to include the main recipe:\n\n```ruby\ninclude_recipe 'dm-crypt::default'\n```\n\nThis installs 2 packages:\n\n* `cryptsetup` - Utilities for interacting with dm-crypt.\n* `file` - Used to determine if devices are correctly formatted.\n\n### dmcrypt_device\n\nEach device to be formatted by dm-crypt is defined by a `dmcrypt_device` custom resource.\n\nEach `dmcrypt_device` has the following attributes:\n\n| Attribute  | Type   | Description                                      | Default |\n|:----------:|:------:|:------------------------------------------------:|:-------:|\n| name       | String | Resource name.                                   | N/A     |\n| device     | String | The absolute path to the device to be formatted. | N/A     |\n| passphrase | String | Passphrase used to encrypt the device.           | N/A     \n| keyfile    | String | Key file used to encrypt the device.             | N/A     |\n\n> NOTE: You must supply either a `passphrase` or a `keyfile` but never both.\n\nTo encrypt an LVM partition:\n\n```ruby\ndmcrypt_device 'enc_data' do\n  device '/dev/mapper/vg_enc-lv_data'\n  passphrase 'supersecretword'\nend\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you would like to contribute to this cookbook please follow these steps;\n\n1.
