{"name":"dbforbix","version":"0.5.1","description":"Installs/Configures dbforbix database monitoring solution for zabbix","long_description":"# dbforbix Cookbook\n\nDescription\n\n# Requirements\n\n## Cookbooks\n\nThe following cookbooks are dependencies for this:\n\n* systemd - needed to install dbforbix services on systemd.\n\n## Java\n\nThis daemon needs java to work. I decided to not depend the\njava cookbook on this because many people install java using other methods.\n\n## Platform\n\nThe following platforms are supported and tested:\n\n* CentOS 7.2\n\n## Chef Server\n\nThe recommended chef version is at least >= 12.5\n\n# Usage\n\nTo use the cookbook, you can just add the `default` recipe to the run_list. It\nwill install on /opt/dbforbix and and configure the daemon and init scripts.\n\n# Attributes\n\nTake a look at the attributes if you want to customize install location and\nconfiguration options.\n\nAttributes are documented on `attributes/default.rb` file. This way I don't need\nto duplicate definitions here and there :)\n\n# Additional drivers\n\nThe recipe `dbforbix::drivers` contains some driver packages to download and\ninstall. But unfortunately, dbforbix 3.x does not support loading external\njars, so the jars must be embedded in the main `dbforbix\\_run.jar` file.\n\nIf you want additional drivers, create a custom package bundle and use it. For\nexample, to include the MSSQL JDBC driver, download the archive from the internet\n(url is at the `attributes/drivers.rb` file), and repack the `dbforbix_run.jar`, \nincluding the file `mssql-jdbc-6.2.2.jre8.jar` and modifying the manifest.\n\n# License and Author\n\n- Author:: Hugo Cisneiros (<hugo.cisneiros@movile.com>)\n- Author:: Tiago Cruz (<tiago.cruz@movile.com>)\n\nCopyright 2018, Movile\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n","maintainer":"Hugo Cisneiros (Eitch)","maintainer_email":"hugo.cisneiros@movile.com","license":"Apache-2.0","platforms":{"centos":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{"systemd":">= 0.0.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"source_url":"https://github.com/Movile/chef-dbforbix","issues_url":"https://github.com/Movile/chef-dbforbix/issues","chef_version":[[">= 12.5"]],"ohai_version":[]}
