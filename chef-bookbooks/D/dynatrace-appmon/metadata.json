The default download link can be overridden via the `node['dynatrace']['agents_package'][$platform]['installer']['file_url']` attribute. Alternatively, you can place the installer artifact as `dynatrace-agent.jar` (Linux) or as `dynatrace-agent.msi` (Windows) in the cookbook's `files` directory from where it will be picked up during the installation. Please refer to `attributes/agents_package.rb` for a list of supported attributes. In order to have the Chef Recipe executed, include `recipe[dynatrace::agents_package]` in a runlist and override attributes as required.\r\n\r\n**Note:** this recipe merely makes the Dynatrace Agents available, but it does not configure your application to actually load any. See the `java_agent` recipe for an example that does.\r\n\r\n### agents_package_uninstall\r\n\r\nThis recipe uninstalls the Dynatrace Agents package installed by the `agents_package` recipe.\r\n\r\n**Note:** this recipe does not delete the user created by the `dynatrace_user` recipe which is included by the `agents_package` recipe.\r\n**Note:** as part of the uninstallation process the `opt/dynatrace` directory is deleted which is by default shared by other Dynatrace components (e.g. `wsagent_package`).\r\n\r\n### apache_wsagent\r\n\r\n*Installs the Dynatrace WebServer Agent for the Apache HTTP Server.*\r\n\r\nThis recipe downloads and installs the most recent version of the Dynatrace WebServer Agent package from [http://downloads.dynatracesaas.com](http://downloads.dynatracesaas.com) and integrates the agent with the Apache HTTP Server.

In order to have the Chef Recipe executed, include `recipe[dynatrace::java_agent]` in a runlist and override attributes as required.\r\n\r\n**Note:** this recipe makes the Java Agent available to a Java Virtual Machine by injecting an appropriate [-agentpath](https://community.compuwareapm.com/community/display/DOCDT65/Java+Agent+Configuration) option into an environment variable, e.g. `JAVA_OPTS`, inside a file (typically an executable script). It is assumed that this script either executes the Java process directly or is sourced by another script before the Java process gets executed. You will have to restart the application after placing the agent.\r\n\r\n**Note:** it is only possible to inject one agent on one machine using this recipe. To inject more agents it is possible to use the `resources/java_agent.rb` resource which sets the `node['dynatrace']['java_agent']['javaopts'][$agent_name]` with options to be passed to the JVM (e.g. `-agentpath:/opt/dynatrace/agent/lib64/libdtagent.so=name=BusinessBackend_easyTravel,server=dynasprint-collector.dynatracesaas.com:9998`).\r\n\r\n### memory_analysis_server\r\n\r\nThis recipe downloads and installs the most recent version of the Dynatrace Memory Analysis Server from [http://downloads.dynatracesaas.com](http://downloads.dynatracesaas.com).

Alternatively, you may as well run these tests in virtual machines based on [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) (see `.kitchen.vagrant.yml`).\r\n\r\n## Platforms\r\n\r\n### Linux\r\n\r\n- CentOS\r\n- Debian\r\n- Red Hat Enterprise Linux\r\n- Ubuntu\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\n- Windows 2012\r\n\r\n## Problems?
