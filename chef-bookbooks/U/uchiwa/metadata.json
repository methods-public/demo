A simple dashboard for [Sensu](http://sensuapp.org/). This cookbook uses the omnibus packages.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sensu/uchiwa-chef.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/sensu/uchiwa-chef)\n\n# Installation methods\n\nThe cookbook supports the following installation methods:\n\n+ repo (default)\n+ http\n\n# Supported platforms\n\nThese plateforms have been tested successfully.\n\n+ Centos/RHEL 6 and 7 x86_64\n+ Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 amd64\n\n# Contributing\n\n+ Smaller commits are better if we need to cherry pick.\n+ Make sure foodcritic runs without errors.\n+ Make sure 'knife cookbook test' runs without errors.\n+ Make sure 'kitchen test' runs without errors.\n+ Make sure 'rubocop' runs without errors.\n+ Write tests for your change.\n\n# Authors\n\n* Author: Justin Kolberg (<amd.prophet@gmail.com>)\n* Author: Jean-Francois Theroux (<me@failshell.io>)\n\n## Build and Release\n\nFor maintainers looking to release new versions of this cookbook you should follow this process:\n1. Add any `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` changes with links to Pull Requests. Commit this to develop branch.\n1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with new version header and update diff links.\n1. Create a commit to then tag for release I would suggest something like this `git commit -am 'prep for v$MAJOR.$MINOR.$RELEASE release'`. Commit this to develop and make sure that everything is good to go (ci passing and such).\n1. Push from develop to master: `git push origin develop:master`\n1. checkout master branch and pull in changes: `git checkout master && git pull`\n1. Create a tagged release: `hub release create v$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH` this should prompt you in an editor to modify the tag message. I typically leave it default, but feel free to include any useful release notes.\n1. Use the `stove` command to push the newly versioned cookbook to the supermarket: `stove --no-git`. This assumes that you have installed `stove`, properly configured authentication, and have been granted access to the supermarket.\n1. Optionally but recommended to update any associated PRs with a release link.\n","maintainer":"Justin Kolberg","maintainer_email":"amd.prophet@gmail.com","license":"Apache-2.0","platforms":{"ubuntu":">= 0.0.0","debian":">= 0.0.0","centos":">= 0.0.0","redhat":">= 0.0.0","fedora":">= 0.0.0","amazon":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{"chef-vault":">= 1.3.1"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"source_url":"https://github.com/sensu/uchiwa-chef","issues_url":"https://github.com/sensu/uchiwa-chef/issues","chef_version":[[">= 12.14"]],"ohai_version":[]}
