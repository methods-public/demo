{"name":"ucspi-tcp","version":"1.3.0","description":"Installs ucspi-tcp","long_description":"# ucspi-tcp Cookbook\n\nInstalls [DJB's ucspi-tcp](http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp.html) software.\n\n# Requirements\n\n## Platform\n\nThe following platforms are supported, and tested via Test Kitchen.\n\n- Ubuntu / Debian\n- RHEL / Fedora\n\nThis cookbook may work on other versions of these platform / platform families with or without modification.\n\nThe following platforms are supported on a best effort basis.\n\n- ArchLinux\n- Gentoo\n\n## Cookbooks\n\n- build-essential: for source recipe\n- pacman: for AUR installation on ArchLinux\n\n# Attributes\n\n- `node['ucspi']['install_method']`: the method of installation, which tells the default recipe which recipe to load. default is `package` for most platforms, and `source` for RHEL. It is `aur` for ArchLinux as Arch doesn't have ucspi-tcp package in the default repositories. See **Usage** below.\n- `node['ucspi']['bin_dir']`: location of the installed binaries. the default is `/usr/bin` for package and aur install methods, and `/usr/local/bin` for source installs.\n\n# Usage\n\nInclude the ucspi-tcp recipe in the run list. The installation method will automatically be selected based on what we consider to be sane defaults.\n\n## Installing from Package on RHEL\n\nIf you have an internal package of `ucspi-tcp` for RHEL and wish to use that, then either specifically use the `package` recipe, or set the `install_method` attribute to `package` for your node/role/environment.\n\n# Bugs\n\nPlease [report bugs](https://github.com/jtimberman/ucspi-tcp) with this cookbook. Include the following information:\n\n- Chef version (`chef-client --version`)\n- Platform and platform version (`ohai platform` and `ohai platform_version`)\n- Version of this cookbook used\n- Output of the error, and Chef stacktrace\n- Steps to reproduce\n\n# License & Authors\n\n- Author: Joshua Timberman ([joshua@chef.io](mailto:joshua@chef.io))\n\n```text\nCopyright 2010-2016, Chef Software, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n","maintainer":"Joshua Timberman","maintainer_email":"cookbooks@housepub.org","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"ubuntu":">= 0.0.0","debian":">= 0.0.0","centos":">= 0.0.0","redhat":">= 0.0.0","arch":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{"build-essential":">= 0.0.0","pacman":">= 0.0.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{"ucspi-tcp":"Installs ucspi-tcp based on \"install_method\" attribute","ucspi-tcp::aur":"Installs ucspi-tcp via AUR (Arch User Repository)","ucspi-tcp::package":"Installs ucspi-tcp via distribution-provided package","ucspi-tcp::source":"Installs ucspi-tcp via compiled source"}}
