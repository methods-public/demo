Default false (allow OOM to kill the process). Optional.\n* `default['copperegg']['proxy']` = Proxy server required to talk to the revealcloud api servers, such as `myproxy.mycorp.com:8080`.  Optional.  Leave blank unless you know what you are doing.\n* `default['copperegg']['use_fqdn']` = Flag for using the fqdn as the uuid. true  => Agent will be started with -U node.fqdn .

Default false.\n* `default['copperegg']['remove_on_uninstall']` = Uninstall collector and remove it's data from Uptime Cloud Monitor. Default false.\n\nUsage\n=====\n1. Download the Uptime Cloud Monitor cookbook into your `chef-repo/cookbooks/uptime_cloud_monitor` directory: (the cookbook directory name must be uptime_cloud_monitor)\n* `git clone https://github.com/CopperEgg/chef-copperegg.git ./uptime_cloud_monitor`, or\n*  manually download from the Opscode community site `http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/uptime_cloud_monitor`, or\n* `knife cookbook site install uptime_cloud_monitor`\n2. Set your apikey as described in the `Attributes` section.\n* edit `uptime_cloud_monitor/attributes/default.rb` and change YOUR_USER_API_KEY to be correct.\n* or override `node['copperegg']['apikey']` within role or environment.\n3. Set any other optional attributes described above, as desired.\n4. Upload the cookbook to your chef server or hosted chef:\n* `knife cookbook upload -a` to upload all cookbooks or\n* `knife cookbook upload uptime_cloud_monitor --include-dependencies`\n* To install dependencies, run `knife cookbook site install curl 2.0.3` and `knife cookbook site install apt 3.0.0`\n5. Include `recipe[uptime_cloud_monitor]` in the run_list for all of your servers.\n* `knife node run_list add NODES 'recipe[uptime_cloud_monitor]'`\n6. Run chef-client on your nodes in whatever manner suits you, such as `sudo chef-client` or a batch job.\n7. View your systems within 10 seconds in the [RevealCloud App](https://app.copperegg.com/#revealcloud/overview)\n\n\nCreating and managing website and port probes\n=====\n1. The Uptime Cloud Monitor Cookbook contains a LightWeight Resource Provider (LWRP) for simplifying the automation of Uptime Cloud Monitor probes.\n2. To create a Uptime Cloud Monitor probe, you need to include something similar to the following example:\n\n```ruby\n  uptime_cloud_monitor_probe \"ChefProbe2\" do\n    probe_desc 'ChefProbe2'               # the 'name' of the probe\n    probe_dest \"http://yoursite.com\"      # the URL to test\n    type 'GET'                            # the test type; in this case, an HTTP GET request\n    stations ['dal','nrk']                # override the defaults and specify testing from Dallas and Fremont\n    tags [\"production\",'load_balancer']   # The tags to apply to this probe\n    action :update                        # update will create or updatee\n  end\n```\n\n3. You can find descriptions of all required and optional fields in uptime_cloud_monitor/resources/probe.rb.\n4. Refer to the Probe section of the Uptime Cloud Monitor API for further details:  [Uptime Cloud Monitor Probe API](http://dev.copperegg.com/revealuptime/probes.html)\n\n\nCreating Annotations in the Uptime Cloud Monitor UI for chef run events.\n=====\nThe Uptime Cloud Monitor Cookbook includes integration with the Chef Report and Exception\nHandlers. To enable this functionality choose one of the following:\n* Include the recipe copperegg-handler.rb in your run_list, or\n* Include the recipe copperegg-handler in your application cookbook with\n`include_recipe`.\n\nThat's it!\n\nNote:\n* By default, each chef run will create an annotation at Uptime Cloud Monitor only when the chef run fails.\n* You can change this behavior by changing the ['copperegg']['annotate_chefrun_success'] and ['copperegg']['annotate_chefrun_fail'] attributes in the default attributes file or by overriding them in your application cookbook.\n\n\nLinks\n=====\n* [Uptime Cloud Monitor Homepage](https://www.idera.com/infrastructure-monitoring-as-a-service/)\n* [Uptime Cloud Monitor Signup](https://app.copperegg.com/signup)\n* [Uptime Cloud Monitor Login](https://app.copperegg.com/login)\n\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\nAuthors:: Ross Dickey, Scott Johnson\nWith Contributions from Drew Oliner (https://github.com/Drewzar)\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright Â© 2012-2017 [IDERA](http://idera.com)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"),\nto deal in the Software without restriction, including without\nlimitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,\nsublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons\nto whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
