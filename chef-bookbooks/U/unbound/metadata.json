{"name":"unbound","version":"1.0.0","description":"Manages unbound DNS resolver","long_description":"# Unbound Cookbook\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sous-chefs/unbound.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sous-chefs/unbound) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/unbound.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/unbound)\n\nInstalls and manages the unbound DNS server.\n\n* http://unbound.net\n\n## Requirements\n\nA platform with unbound available as a native package. The following platforms have unbound packaged, but note that the filesystem locations are not consistent and at this time only Linux + FHS is supported.\n\n* Ubuntu/Debian\n* Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora (requires EPEL)\n* FreeBSD\n\n## Resources\n\n### unbound_install\n\nInstall unbound from package.\n\n### unbound_configure\n\nConfigures:\n- unbound.conf\n- forward-zone.conf\n- local-zone.conf\n- stub-zone.conf\n\nFor example usage see `test/fixtures/cookbooks/test/recipes/configure.rb`\n\n### unbound.conf\n\nThe main configuration file for unbound. Many settings in the template are controlled via properties on the `unbound_configure` resource. The file is located in the location specified in the `dir` property.\n\n### local-zone.conf\n\nSet up local network resolver configuration with local-zone.conf.\n\n### stub-zone.conf\n\nEdit the stub-zone.erb template to create a stub zone configuration.\n\n### forward-zone.conf\n\nEdit the forward-zone.erb template to create a forward zone configuration.\n\n## Recipes\n\n### default\n\nInstalls and configures unbound using defaults.\n\nThis example recipe will load the local zone data from a data bag if present, otherwise it will attempt to use `node['dns']['domain']` attribute. The various templates can be edited as required by the local user.\n\nIf this does not meet your needs use the `unbound_configure` resource directly.\n\n### chroot (TODO)\n\nThe intention of this recipe will be to setup the chroot environment if the chroot setting is enabled. However it is not yet complete.\n\n### `remote_control` (TODO)\n\nSets up remote control certificate attributes using the unbound configuration directory. Also creates the config file for remote-control settings and creates the certificates with unbound-control-setup.\n\n## Usage\n\n## License and Author\n\nCopyright 2011, Joshua Timberman (<cookbooks@housepub.org>)\nCopyright 2017, Dan Webb (<dan.webb@damacus.io>)\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n","maintainer":"Sous Chefs","maintainer_email":"help@sous-chefs.org","license":"Apache-2.0","platforms":{"debian":">= 0.0.0","ubuntu":">= 0.0.0","centos":">= 0.0.0","redhat":">= 0.0.0","scientific":">= 0.0.0","oracle":">= 0.0.0","amazon":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"source_url":"https://github.com/sous-chefs/unbound","issues_url":"https://github.com/sous-chefs/unbound/issues","chef_version":[[">= 12.5"]],"ohai_version":[]}
