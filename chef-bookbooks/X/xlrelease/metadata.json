XL Release license: If you are an XL Release Community Edition user, you should have received your license during the sign-up process. Enterprise users can download their license from the [XebiaLabs licence server](https://tech.xebialabs.com/download/license) (requires credentials).\n2. Operating system: Windows or Unix-family operating system running Java.\n3. Java Runtime Environment: JDK 7 (Oracle, IBM or Apple)\n4. RAM: At least 2GB of RAM available for XL Release.\n5. Hard disk space: At least 2GB of hard disk space to store the XL Release repository (this depends on your usage of XL Release)\n\nDepending on the environment, the following may also be required:\n\n1. Database: XL Release's repository may be stored in a database; for more information, see Configuring the repository\n2. LDAP: To enable group-based security, an LDAP x.509 compliant registry is required; for more information, see Configuring LDAP security\n\n*Downloading the installation archive*\n\nThis cookbook uses `wget` to download the installation archive from XebiaLabs.\nSet attribute ['xlrelease']['downloadurl'] to this installation archive.\nSet attribute default['xlrelease']['username'] = 'supplied by xebialabs'\nSet attribute default['xlrelease']['password'] = 'supplied by xebialabs'\n\n*Using the default recipe the below steps are executed*\n\n1. Creates xlrelease user and group.\n2. Creates an installation directory `/opt/xl-release-4.0.x-server`. This can be changed via attributes.\n3. `wget`s the XL Release installation archive from the ['xlrelease']['downloadurl'] attribute.\n4. Extracts the archive into the installation directory.\n5. Changes ownership of the installation directory to be owned by xlrelease user and group.\n6. Configures the `xl-release-server.conf` file through the setup.config.txt.erb template. All values in this setup file can be overwritten by attributes.\n7. Kicks off XL Release's installation program (`server.sh` included in installation archive).\n8. Configures xlrelease as a service (using runit).\n\n# Post-installation\n\nAdd the license file to your installation directory's `~/conf` subdirectory and restart the xlrelease service\n\n```sv down xlrelease; sv up xlrelease```\n\n# Contributing\n\n1. Fork it!\n2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`\n3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`\n4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`\n5.
