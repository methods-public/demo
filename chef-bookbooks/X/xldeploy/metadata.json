Connect to Windows and Unix target systems using proven, industry-standard remote protocols; no agent installation and maintenance, no overhead on the target systems, no firewall ports to be opened, and no security reviews.\n\n# Server requirements\nTo install the XL Deploy server, the following prerequisites must be met:\n\n1. XL Deploy license: You can download your license from https://tech.xebialabs.com/download/license.\n2. Operating system: Windows or Unix-family operating system running Java.\n3. Java Runtime Environment: JDK 7 (Oracle, IBM or Apple)\n4. RAM: At least 2GB of RAM available for XL Deploy.\n5. Hard disk space: Sufficient hard disk space to store the XL Deploy repository. This depends on your usage of XL Deploy. See Determining hard disk space requirements.\n\nDepending on the environment, the following may also be required:\n\n1. Database: XL Deploy's Jackrabbit repository supports a number of different databases. For more information, see Configuring the repository.\n2. LDAP: To enable group-based security, an LDAP x.509 compliant registry is needed. For more information, see Configuring LDAP security.\n\n**Download Installation Archive**\nThe cookbook is using wget to download the installation archive from xebialabs.\nSet attribute ['xldeploy']['downloadurl'] to this installation archive.\nSet attribute default['xldeploy']['username'] = 'supplied by xebialabs'\nSet attribute default['xldeploy']['password'] = 'supplied by xebialabs'\n\n**Using the default recipe the below steps are executed**\n1.
