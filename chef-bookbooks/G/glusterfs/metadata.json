  "long_description": "GlusterFS\n=========\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nGlusterFS is a scalable network filesystem. Using common off-the-shelf\nhardware, you can create large, distributed storage solutions for media\nstreaming, data analysis, and other data- and bandwidth-intensive tasks.\nGlusterFS is free and open source software.\n\nThis cookbook focuses on deploying a GlusterFS cluster via Chef.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n### Cookbooks and gems\n\nDeclared in [metadata.rb](metadata.rb) and in [Gemfile](Gemfile).\n\n### Platforms\n\nA *systemd* managed distribution:\n- RHEL Family 7, tested on Centos 7.2\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n### Easy Setup\n\nSet `node['glusterfs']['hosts']` to an array containing the hostnames of\nthe nodes of the GlusterFS cluster.\n\n### Search\n\nThe recommended way to use this cookbook is through the creation of a role\nper **glusterfs** cluster. This enables the search by role feature, allowing a\nsimple service discovery.\n\nIn fact, there are two ways to configure the search:\n1. with a static configuration through a list of hostnames (attributes `hosts`\n   that is `['glusterfs']['hosts']`)\n2. with a real search, performed on a role (attributes `role` and `size`\n   like in `['glusterfs']['role']`). The role should be in the run-list\n   of all nodes of the cluster. The size is a safety and should be the number\n   of nodes in the cluster.\n\nIf hosts is configured, `role` and `size` are ignored\n\nSee [roles](test/integration/roles) for some examples and\n[Cluster Search][cluster-search] documentation for more information.\n\n### Test\n\nThis cookbook is fully tested through the installation of a working 3-nodes\ncluster in docker hosts. This uses kitchen (>= 1.5.0), docker (>= 1.10) and\na small monkey-patch.\n\nAt the moment, the docker images are run in privileged mode which is highly\ninsecure. This is needed by GlusterFS to mount volumes. You are invited to\ncheck the image used (sbernard/centos-systemd-kitchen) for the tests before\nrunning them.\n\nFor more information, see *.kitchen.yml* and *test* directory.\n\nAttributes\n----------\n\nConfiguration is done by overriding default attributes. All configuration keys\nhave a default defined in [attributes/default.rb](attributes/default.rb).\nPlease read it to have a comprehensive view of what and how you can configure\nthis cookbook behavior.\n\nRecipes\n-------\n\n* default\n* repository (setup yum repositories)\n* package (install glusterfs-server)\n* service (make sure glusterd service is enabled and started)\n* configure (probe an host into the cluster and create a volume)\n* client (mount a glusterfs volume)\n\n### Setting Up Clients\n\nPermit access to GlusterFS volumes using Gluster Native Client method\n\n#### Example\n\n```json\n\"glusterfs\": {\n  \"mounts\": {\n    \"myvol\": {\n      \"mount_point\": \"/mnt/data\",\n      \"server\": \"host1.example\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt creates a mount point on the local filesystem at /mnt/data\nusing GlusterFS fuse client.\n\nResources/Providers\n-------------------\n\n### Probe\n\nProbe an host into the GlusterFS cluster.\n\n#### Example\n\n```ruby\nglusterfs_probe 'my-custom-host.test'\n```\n\n### Volume\n\nCreate a GlusterFS volume\n\n#### Example\n\n##### Creation of a replicated volume with two storage servers\n\n```json\n\"glusterfs\": {\n  \"volumes\": {\n    \"myvol\": {\n      \"type\": \"replica\",\n      \"count\": 2,\n      \"transport_type\": \"tcp\",\n      \"mount_points\": [[\n        \"host1.example:/mnt/brick1\",\n        \"host2.example:/mnt/brick2\",\n      ]],\n      \"action\": [[\"create\", \"start\"]]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\nAvailable in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG).\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPlease read carefully [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a merge\nrequest.\n\nLicense and Author\n------------------\n\n- Author:: Samuel Bernard (<samuel.bernard@s4m.io>)\n- Author:: Florian Philippon (<florian.philippon@s4m.io>)\n\n```text\nCopyright (c) 2016 Sam4Mobile\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n",
