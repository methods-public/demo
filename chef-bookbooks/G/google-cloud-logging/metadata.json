Configures the required apt or yum repository.\n      The environment variable REPO_SUFFIX can be set to alter which\n      repository is used.  A dash (-) will be inserted prior to the supplied\n      suffix. Example values are 'unstable' or '20151027-1'.\n   2. Installs the logging agent.\n   3. Installs \"catch-all\" configuration files (unless the environment\n      variable DO_NOT_INSTALL_CATCH_ALL_CONFIG is set to suppress this.)\n   4. Starts the logging agent.\n   5. Sends a test message which should be visible in the log viewer.\n\nGoogle Cloud Logging collects and stores logs from applications and services on the Google Cloud Platform:\n\n   * View your logs with the Logs Viewer, including third-party logs from your virtual machine instances.\n   * Export your logs to Google Cloud Storage, Google BigQuery, or Google Cloud Pub/Sub.\n   * Create logs-based metrics to use for monitoring and alerting in Google Cloud Monitoring.\n   * Get immutable audit logs for auditing and compliance.\n   * Use the Cloud Logging API to read, write, and configure logs.\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n### Platform\nThe platforms supported are Amazon Linux, Debian/Ubuntu, Redhat/CentOS\n\n### Packages\nThe cookbook uses default package managers for the platform\n\nAttributes\n----------\nNone\n\nLicense and Authors\n-------------------\nAuthors: Vipin Thomas, Karthik Subramanian\n",
